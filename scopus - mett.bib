	abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important tools for maintaining biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and conserving and restoring natural ecosystems. Management effectiveness assessment is an important component of conservation management in protected areas. In this study, we constructed a management effectiveness assessment tool based on publicly available information for China, with a total score of 126. We used the tool to systematically assess 27 national MPAs in the East China Sea. Our results showed that marine nature reserves (MNRs) and marine special reserves (MSRs) could be classified into two and three classifications, respectively, including MNRs I (n = 4, scores = 88-100), MNRs II (n = 6, scores = 75-81), MSRs I (n = 8, scores = 75-90), MSRs II (n = 6, scores = 59-75) and MSRs III (n = 3, scores = 53-56). Factors influencing the management effectiveness of nature reserves were the length of establishment and general public budget revenue, while for special reserves they were the length of establishment and total agricultural output value. Furthermore, protected areas with high management effectiveness scores tend to have a longer establishment time, dedicated management departments, adequate management staff and financial investment compared to those with low scores. In addition, the low-score MPAs require more communication with stakeholders. The study provides an objective and comprehensive systematic scoring of MPAs’ management using METT-based framework and multi-source data. It overcomes the challenge of the general lack of data on MPAs and provides a new approach to management effectiveness assessment. Copyright © 2023 Chen, Zeng, Zeng, Liu, Wang, Shi and Cao.},

	abstract = {We studied the effectiveness of protected area management within a Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) priority place for conservation investment, located in the coastal areas of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. At least 473 sites in this region have completed Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) assessments since 2003, often associated with Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded projects, but also through work funded by other donors and WWF itself. We show that community managed reserves score higher using the METT tool when compared with sites managed by the state forest agencies. We situate this within the context of approaches to reserve management in Tanzania, where state-managed Forest Reserves have received little in terms of funding support and score lowest when compared with all other management types in Tanzania. Further, we show that slightly higher average METT scores for sites where WWF are working across Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique, when compared with all other sites, are most pronounced in elements of the METT tool relating to inputs, process and planning, and are not seen in outputs or outcomes. We discuss the utility of the METT tool for organisations like WWF to evaluate their impact in protected area management, including the issue of systematic bias in data recording (WWF facilitation of assessments) and that more time may be required to see the outcomes and impacts from any management improvements that have been achieved. © 2018, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

	abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) play an important role in biodiversity conservation and the implementation of ambitious multilateral environmental agreements, like the 2010 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In the CBD's Programme of Work on Protected Areas, it is requested that each country conduct management effectiveness evaluations of at least thirty percent of its PAs by 2010. This article compares the most common methodologies of PA management effectiveness evaluations, such as the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) Methodology, the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) and UNESCO's Enhancing our Heritage (EoH) Toolkit. These and other methodologies can help to (1) examine overall effectiveness of PAs, (2) identify factors influencing the effectiveness and (3) determine common threats and their seriousness.However, the outcomes of major studies concerning overall effectiveness as well as success and failure factors for PA management are partially contradictory. Different results can be due to the approach (e.g. number and type of indicators or assessors included in the evaluation process) or to the individual context of the PA (e.g. age, region, IUCN category) and therefore these factors need to be considered when comparing results of management effectiveness studies.Research indicates that increased attention should be paid to regular monitoring of conservation activities in PAs including systematic social science studies with a socio-economic and socio-cultural focus. Unfortunately, the outcomes of the management effectiveness studies are not easily accessible and have not yet been widely shared or distributed among the conservation community. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.},

	abstract = {Ramsar Sites, wetlands of international importance, are an international category of protected wetland areas recognized under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Protected areas around the world are not achieving the conservation objectives for which they were established, often due to a lack in effective management practices. Hence, protected area management effectiveness and its assessments are crucial elements of achieving responsive and pro-active management. Ramsar Sites that are not recognized as a protected area under the national park and wildlife conservation act in Nepal are often ignored for such assessments and receive little attention in terms of conservation and management. This study aimed to fill this gap by assessing Jagadishpur Reservoir Ramsar Site, which falls into the above category. The Ramsar Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool was used to assess the management effectiveness. Transformed into the global standard reporting format, the overall management effectiveness was 0.27 on a 0 to 1 scale. This score is considered to be in an inadequate range, requiring significant conservation intervention from government with support from conservation partners. This first assessment of Ramsar Site outside of protected area in Nepal and its comparison to global and European regional-level assessments provides the benchmark for future evaluation to track progress in management effectiveness. In conclusion, Ramsar Sites outside formally protected areas are often neglected and intermittent projects, and ad hoc implementation of small-scale activities seems inadequate to improve management effectiveness. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat was developed in 1971, and has established the world’s largest network of protected areas. However, monitoring and reporting have been inadequate to fully achieve the goals of the Convention. We argue that current reporting mechanisms, including the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM), and the R-METT reporting framework adopted at the 12th Conference of the Parties, are not well adapted to wetland systems and the objectives of the Ramsar Convention. This paper outlines one possible structure for a new reporting mechanism, explicitly focused on the Convention’s objectives of maintaining ecological character and promoting wise use within the context of sustainable development. Through these lenses, we developed a 15-question framework that would have site managers compile the most pertinent information relating to these two points quickly, including providing operational definitions, identifying allowable uses, quantifying economic benefits, reporting fundamental monitoring data, and assessing stakeholder engagement opportunities. We argue that, if we are to provide an informed outlook for the next half-century of wetland conservation under the Ramsar Convention, we must begin by refining its information-gathering protocols for its system of wetlands of international importance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The establishment of protected areas (PA) is one of the most prominent biodiversity conservation policies in the Philippines. Functions of the country’s PA policy include the reduction of deforestation, forest conservation, and decreasing human pressure on natural resources. This study aimed to assess the drivers of forest intactness and fragmentation in selected terrestrial PAs. Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) scores were used to consider the impact of drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) change, including economic development, population, road networks, cultivation, and PA management, on the percentage of forest cover and different fragmentation metrics in the PAs. The study conducted a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Multiple Regression Analysis to identify the significant drivers of LULC change for each response variable. CCA and Multiple Regression Analysis results showed the most important predictors of LULC based on their canonical weights: cultivation within the PA, the human development index, and the regional gross domestic product. Aside from being the most important driving factor based on the CCA, cultivation inside the PA was also found to be a common significant variable for most dependent variables. Other significant factors were poverty index, population, and road density, which could all provide a basis for the observed PA fragmentation. The study also found that higher METT scores had a negative influence on the open forest and a positive effect on patch richness. This indicates that open forests tend to decrease as PA management improves while patch richness tends to increase. Furthermore, there is no data to support that METT scores have a significant influence on other response variables. © 2023, Philippine-American Academy of Science and Engineering.

This study aims to [1] determine the plant and other forest bioresource utilization of the local communities in NNNP, [2] assess the threats to the park and its biodiversity due to the utilization of bioresources, and [3] evaluate the Institutional Management Regime for NNNP. The data was gathered using focus groups, key informant interviews, and household surveys. For the secondary data, information was also accessed from the Office of the Protected Area Superintendent and local government units. One hundred thirteen (113) species are used for food (26%), ornamental (24%), herbal or medicinal value (19%), construction (12%), commercial (9%), charcoal and fuel wood (8%), and craft (3%) based on data collected from 643 families in the 11 cities and municipalities that make up the protected area. Housing construction, settlement, and the production of annual and non-perennial timber crops were all noted as major threats identified in the park. According to the review of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), the “context” and “planning” components were the strengths of the protected area employing the management rating of 64 and 53.8%, respectively. The Republic Act No. 11038, commonly known as the Expanded National Integrated Protected Area System (ENIPAS), is the sole unambiguous law that governs bioresource harvesting in protected areas. In addition, policies imposed by cooperatives and villages were used to control the usage and harvesting of bioresources. These findings gave us a crucial socioeconomic and institutional understanding of the landscape, preparing us to make interventions and create management plans to deal with problems involving the use of bioresources in the protected area. © 2023, Department of Science and Technology.

	abstract = {Protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity, natural habitats, ecosystem services and cultural values. Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

However, illegal activities, offenders arrested, and livelihood beneficiaries strongly correlated positively with all the elements. Again, Pearson correlation tests among patrols, illegal activities and mammals observed were not statistically significant.

The questionnaire was applied to Ecuadorian National Parks management teams through face-to-face interviews. The resulted overall management effectiveness indices are between 40.6% and 99.0%. The general condition of biodiversity value was considered as good in line with the legal status and National Parks design but topics related to budget allocation, tourism arrangements, communities and indigenous people received lower scores. The low enforcement emphasis is not necessarily the best way to improve management effectiveness; the identified issues should be addressed by including communities and indigenous people in the decision making and benefits sharing as well as strategic allocation of budgetary resources, with proper adaptation to Natural Parks’ specific conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Protected area coverage has reached over 15% of the global land area. However, the quality of management of the vast majority of reserves remains unknown, and many are suspected to be "paper parks". Moreover, the degree to which management can be enhanced through targeted conservation projects remains broadly speculative. Proven links between improved reserve management and the delivery of conservation outcomes are even more elusive. In this paper we present results on how management effectiveness scores change in protected areas receiving conservation investment, using a globally expanded database of protected area management effectiveness, focusing on the "management effectiveness tracking tool" (METT). Of 1934 protected areas with METT data, 722 sites have at least two assessments. Mean METT scores increased in 69.5% of sites while 25.1% experienced decreases and 5.4% experienced no change over project periods (median 4. years). Low initial METT scores and longer implementation time were both found to positively correlate with larger increases in management effectiveness. Performance metrics related to planning and context as well as monitoring and enforcement systems increased the most while protected area outcomes showed least improvement. Using a general linear mixed model we tested the correlation between change in METT scores and matrices of 1) landscape and protected area properties (i.e. topography and size), 2) human threats (i.e. road and human population density), and 3) socio-economics (i.e. infant mortality rate). Protected areas under greater threat and larger protected areas showed greatest improvements in METT. Our results suggest that when funding and resources are targeted at protected areas under greater threat they have a greater impact, potentially including slowing the loss of biodiversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Our study examined the monitoring and evaluation of protected area management effectiveness (PAME) as part of an adaptive management process in the Kruger to Canyons (K2C) Biosphere Region in South Africa. Our mixed methods approach, using online questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups, revealed that most PA managers in the network were familiar with the concept of adaptive management. The most widely used PAME evaluation tool used in the region was the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT). Some PAs did not use a formal tool but gathered scientific data using methods such as game counts and vegetation surveys to judge management effectiveness. Additionally, several managers that did not use a formal tool mentioned that they were constrained by time, staff capacity or budget. The introduction of a simpler tool for managers that are time- or resource-constrained or who are working in a newly declared or in-process PA may improve PAME evaluation within the network. We suggest that there is a need for improved communication, co-learning, and information sharing regarding PAME evaluation tools. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We report on land management and protected area management effectiveness in the tiger range. Wild tigers Panthera tigris are found in 13 countries, with habitat that is also important for ecosystem services, biodiversity and a number of other threatened species. Timber production, mineral mining, oil and gas concessions and protected areas are common land-use designations in tiger habitat. Twenty-one per cent of the current tiger range is under some form of protection, while 9% is designated as 'strictly protected,' in IUCN categories I or II. Fifteen per cent of the tiger range is under oil and gas concession. These concessions also overlap 152 protected areas, 55 of which are categorized as strictly protected. Management effectiveness tracking tool responses suggest that the majority of protected areas in the tiger range are inadequately managed to meet their objectives, and the most commonly reported management challenges are minimal enforcement and budgets. We observe that even strictly protected areas are subject to a variety of pressures, particularly resource extraction. Results imply that the establishment and enforcement of effective protected areas in each tiger landscape, sufficient to protect and grow breeding tiger populations, could help change current trends. These areas should be free from incompatible land uses, and should be adequately resourced to meet management, enforcement and monitoring challenges. Weaknesses in protected area management identified here have implications for species and ecosystem services that share the same geography as tigers. In addition, results suggest that similar issues may exist for threatened species and protected areas in other geographies as well. © 2011 World Wildlife Fund, Inc. © 2011 The Zoological Society of London.},

However, global studies claim that the PA systems seem to fail in securing large ecosystem mosaics that are needed to protect threatened and endemic species. There is a myriad of metrices to measure the management effectiveness of protected areas. This review paper explored the use of Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) for assessing management capacity of protected areas in the Philippines and other possible indicators that are measurable and verifiable to holistically assess PA performance. Our review showed the following results: 1) Philippine protected areas showed improvement from poor to fair in METT scores from 2013 to 2017; 2) PA design elements did not fully cover species survival envelopes and suitable habitats; and 3) there was an undesirable inverse relationship between habitat quality and METT scores. To address these, we suggest the adoption of a suite of multidimensional approaches that will take into account a system level performance metric, a performance-based metric, and an ecological/biophysical metric. The combination of these metrics will provide management solutions in ensuring a strategic and sustainable delivery of the twin objectives of the protected areas in the Philippines. © Association of Systematic Biologists of the Philippines},

	abstract = {Protected areas aim to conserve nature, ecosystem services, and cultural values; however, they have variable success in doing so under high development pressure. Southeast Asian protected areas faced the highest level of human pressure at the turn of the twenty-first century. To estimate their effectiveness in conserving forest cover and forest carbon stocks for 2000–2018, we used statistical matching methods to control for the non-random location of protected areas, to compare protection against a matched counterfactual. We found Southeast Asian protected areas had three times less forest cover loss than similar landscapes without protection. Protected areas that had completed management reporting using the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) conserved significantly more forest cover and forest carbon stocks than those that had not. Management scores were positively associated with the level of carbon emissions avoided, but not the level of forest cover loss avoided. Our study is the first to find that METT scores could predict the level of carbon emissions avoided in protected areas. Given that only 11% of protected areas in Southeast Asia had completed METT surveys, our results illustrate the need to scale-up protected area management effectiveness reporting programs to improve their effectiveness for conserving forests, and for storing and sequestering carbon. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The need to assess the management effectiveness (ME) in protected areas is increasing around the world. The ME assessment helps to improve the management of PAs and to develop a rational, long-term action plan. This study was conducted using the World Wildlife Fund for nature (WWF) Management Effectiveness Tracking Tools methodology (METT) to evaluate the ME of six PAs in central and eastern regions of Mongolia. The main purpose of this study was to assess ME and identify common threats of PAs across different natural zones and administrative areas in Mongolia. The results of this evaluation indicate that, the main threats faced by PAs in Mongolia are: (i) degradation of ecosystems, (ii) environmental pollution, and (iii) habitat fragmentation, resulting from over-exploitation and inappropriate use of natural resources. All six PAs examined have clear management goals and management decision-making systems however, their ME scores differ significantly. This research suggests that the administrative features of the individual PA influence management effectiveness and problems in the efficient implementation of management still need to be resolved. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Management-effectiveness scores are used widely by donors and implementers of conservation projects to prioritize, track, and evaluate investments in protected areas. However, there is little evidence that these scores actually reflect the capacity of protected areas to deliver conservation outcomes. We examined the relation between indicators of management effectiveness in protected areas and the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing fire occurrence in the Amazon rainforest. We used data collected with the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) scorecard, adopted by some of the world's largest conservation organizations to track management characteristics believed to be crucial for protected-area effectiveness. We used the occurrence of forest fires from 2000 through 2010 as a measure of the effect of protected areas on undesired land-cover change in the Amazon basin. We used matching to compare the estimated effect of protected areas with low versus high METT scores on fire occurrence. We also estimated effects of individual protected areas on fire occurrence and explored the relation between these effects and METT scores. The relations between METT scores and effects of protected areas on fire occurrence were weak. Protected areas with higher METT scores in 2005 did not seem to have performed better than protected areas with lower METT scores at reducing fire occurrence over the last 10 years. Further research into the relations between management-effectiveness indicators and conservation outcomes in protected areas seems necessary, and our results show that the careful application of matching methods can be a suitable method for that purpose. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

	abstract = {The requirement to assess the management effectiveness (ME) in protected areas (PAs) is increasing around the world to help improve management and accountability. An evaluation of ME for Khojir National Park (KNP), one of the Iran's oldest PAs, was conducted using a multi-method approach that consisted of structured interviews, open interviews, and site visits. This was the first ME evaluation in Iran. The structured interview was based on the management effectiveness tracking tool methodology. KNP received an average score of 43 %, which is lower than the global average, illustrating that its general management was in the low-intermediate level. The indices of legal status, resource inventory, planning for land and water use, regulations, and objectives received the highest average scores, whereas education and awareness, community co-management, regular work plan, boundary demarcation, visitor facilities, budget sources, staff training, protection systems, and management plan received the lowest ones. The management system of KNP was generally established, but many problems of the management still need to be resolved. To improve ME, some countermeasures should be taken, such as increasing funding, strengthening capacity building, planning, and adaptive management, and implementing community participation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Understanding the successes and failures of management of protected areas is vital for the conservation of global biodiversity. The Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) is a simple, questionnaire-based approach for assessing protected area management effectiveness (PAME). Since it was developed in 1999, it has become the most widely applied PAME tool, used in at least 127 countries worldwide. This paper reviews the development of the METT and how it has been implemented and adapted. A combination of literature review on implementation and implementation experience from the original authors and key users of the METT confirms that the METT is a relatively quick and simple way of collecting information about the status and trends of management in protected areas, and provides information to help drive management improvements. As such it is suitable for protected area managers, national protected area agencies, donors, and NGOs aiming to improve area management, and as a component of national reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The paper examines issues related to METT implementation and concludes with 12 recommendations, from using the METT to verification of results, which together help ensure the tool is implemented in the most effective way and improves the credibility of PAME assessments. © Fiona Leverington.},

	abstract = {An assessment of management effectiveness was carried out for all the protected areas in the Kingdom of Bhutan. During 2014-2016 the Royal Government of Bhutan developed a custom-made tool for assessing management effectiveness: The Bhutan Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool Plus (Bhutan METT +). This was implemented in Bhutan's 10 protected areas and one botanical park, and the results were verified through field trips and expert reviews. The assessment indicates that protected areas in Bhutan are well managed and there are generally good relationships with local communities, despite an increase in livestock predation and crop damage. However, effectiveness is limited by a low level of resources (both financial and appropriate technical resources) and by gaps in monitoring and research data, which limits the ability to understand the impact of conservation, react to changing conditions and undertake adaptive management to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Bhutan is in the midst of mobilizing considerable conservation funding. The Government is working in partnership with WWF to create an innovative funding mechanism for the protected area system: The Bhutan for Life initiative. The Bhutan METT + study provides an example of how to develop a baseline against which to measure the effectiveness of protected areas over time and assess the impact of conservation inputs. © 2018 Fauna and Flora International.},
