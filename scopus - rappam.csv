The results indicate that, unlike the situation in most developing countries, the threats and pressures faced by protected areas in Taiwan come mainly from the outside-with pollution as the most common pressure and threat, and difficult for their management authorities to deal with effectively. The categories and extent of these pressures and threats are related to remoteness and geographic location of the protected areas. All five cases under study reveal a similar management approach, clear management goals, adequate basic infrastructure and clear management decision-making; on the down side, however, all of them suffer from the lack of an effective comprehensive management plan, inadequate or poor quality human resources and insufficient funding. The present study suggests that first priority should be given to strengthening management planning in order to improve management effectiveness of protected areas in Taiwan. The adjustment made to RAPPAM in this study was to amend and take the format of the management plan as the basis for evaluation material preparations and open the discussion to encourage stakeholders' participation to open the dialogue among them. The results indicate that, although the system evaluation design still has some constraints, the quality of information collected is improved and can respond more directly to the specific demands of the respective areas. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Community participation; Management planning; Pressure and threat analysis; RAPPAM; Site evaluation; Stakeholder","Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Taiwan; Taiwan; Developing countries; Management; Community participation; Management planning; RAPPAM; Site evaluation; Stakeholder; Threat analysis; decision making; environmental management; local participation; protected area; stakeholder; analytic method; article; decision making; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; geography; organization; pollution control; program development; quality control; Rapid assessment and prioritization of protected areas management methodology; resource management; Taiwan; Quality control","","","","","","","Batsukh N., Belokurov A., Mongolia: Management Effectiveness Assessment of the Mongolian Protected Areas System Using WWF's RAPPAM Methodology, (2005); Bertzky M., Stoll-Kleemann S., Multi-level discrepancies with sharing data on protected areas: What we have and what we need for the global village, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, 1, pp. 8-24, (2009); Borgstrom S., Cousins S.A.O., Lindborg R., Outside the boundary - Land use changes in the surroundings of urban nature reserves, Applied Geography, 32, pp. 350-359, (2011); Chape S., Harrison J., Spalding M., Lysenko I., Measuring the extent and effectiveness of protected areas as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 360, pp. 443-455, (2005); Cook C.N., Hockings M., Opportunities for improving the rigor of management effectiveness evaluations in protected areas, Conservation Letters, 4, 5, pp. 372-382, (2011); Davey A.G., National System Planning for Protected Areas.

In the CBD's Programme of Work on Protected Areas, it is requested that each country conduct management effectiveness evaluations of at least thirty percent of its PAs by 2010. This article compares the most common methodologies of PA management effectiveness evaluations, such as the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) Methodology, the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) and UNESCO's Enhancing our Heritage (EoH) Toolkit. These and other methodologies can help to (1) examine overall effectiveness of PAs, (2) identify factors influencing the effectiveness and (3) determine common threats and their seriousness.However, the outcomes of major studies concerning overall effectiveness as well as success and failure factors for PA management are partially contradictory. Different results can be due to the approach (e.g. number and type of indicators or assessors included in the evaluation process) or to the individual context of the PA (e.g. age, region, IUCN category) and therefore these factors need to be considered when comparing results of management effectiveness studies.Research indicates that increased attention should be paid to regular monitoring of conservation activities in PAs including systematic social science studies with a socio-economic and socio-cultural focus. Unfortunately, the outcomes of the management effectiveness studies are not easily accessible and have not yet been widely shared or distributed among the conservation community. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Management effectiveness evaluations; Programme of work of the convention on biological diversity; Protected areas","","","","","","","","Andam K.S., Ferraro P.J., Pfaff A., Sanchez-Azofeifa G.A., Robalino J.A., Measuring the effectiveness of protected area networks in reducing deforestation, PNAS, 105, 42, pp. 16089-16094, (2008); Balmford A., Bennun L., ten Brink B., Cooper D., Cote I.M., Crane P., Dobson A., Dudley N., Dutton I., Green R.E., Gregory R.D., Harrison J., Kennedy E.T., Kremen C., Leader-Williams N., Lovejoy T.E., Mace G., May R., Mayaux P., Morling P., Phillips J., Redford K., Ricketts T.H., Rodriguez J.P., Sanjayan M., Schei P.J., van Jaarsveld A.S., Walther B.A., ECOLOGY: The Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010 target, Science, 307, pp. 212-213, (2005); Bertzky M., Stoll-Kleemann S., Multi-level discrepancies with sharing data on protected areas: What we have and what we need for the global village, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, pp. 8-24, (2009); Bruner A.G., Gullison R.E., Rice R.E., da Fonseca G.A.B., Effectiveness of parks in protecting tropical biodiversity, Science, 291, pp. 125-128, (2001); Chape S., Harrison J., Spalding M., Lysenko I., Measuring the extent and effectiveness of protected areas as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 360, pp. 443-455, (2005); (2006); Cracco M., Calvopina J., Courrau J., Medina M.M., Novo I., Oetting I., Surkin J., Ulloa R., Vasquez P., Fortalecimiento de la efectividad de manejo de áreas protegidas en los Andes.

The effectiveness and integrity of PA are being challenged and questioned worldwide and this situation is not different in Brazil. Poorly managed PA are more vulnerable to habitat loss, poaching and other threats. Alarmingly, studies have shown that just a fraction of the current PA can be considered effectively managed. Facing such scenario, studies on the effectiveness of the management of PA - and especially marine PA (MPA)- become essential to enhance the role these areas play in biodiversity conservation, as well as provide useful tools for managers and decision-makers. Using the Rapid Assessment and Priorization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) methodology, we evaluated the management effectiveness of the largest MPA in Brazil, the Environmental Protected Area Costa dos Corais (APACC, IUCN category V). In a rare opportunity in the context of Brazil's PA system, we were able to access the management effectiveness of APACC over a 15-year period, tracking progresses, identifying strengthens and weaknesses experienced. The overall management effectiveness of APACC has improved over the last 15 years. Although there were variations, five out of 14 indicators analyzed presented improvements while nine remained stable over the years. Finance was the module that contributed the most for the general improvement of APACC. Contrary to many other PA worldwide, which face budget restrictions, APACC's financial situation is currently stable and such stability may have had a positive effect on other management modules, like Infrastructure and Outputs. Research, Monitoring and Evaluation was among modules with slower progress, which is a contradiction considering APACC is amongst the Brazilian MPA with more research. The feedback from researchers is considered poor and most of the research conducted considered not useful for management purposes. Tourism has the highest increase in criticality, being not only the biggest pressure, but also the main threat. Considering that there were improvements in other areas, increasing APACC's limited staff should be a priority for the coming years. RAPPAM proved to be a quick and easy-to-apply methodology, making it effective for temporal analysis on the management of MPA. However, caution is necessary when analyzing some of RAPPAM results. Frequent changes in the management staff, poor records of the management process and the activities adopted, and incomplete transference of information between staff members inevitably compromises the answers and the overall accuracy. RAPPAM needs in loco validation of the answers and this could be a time consuming process for large PA. For better results, RAPPAM could and should be applied together with other evaluation methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","APA Costa dos Corais; Management effectiveness; Protected areas; RAPPAM","Brazil; Biodiversity; Budget control; Conservation; Decision making; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Public address systems; APA Costa dos Corais; Biodiversity conservation; Environmental Protected Area; Management effectiveness; Monitoring and evaluations; Protected area management; Protected areas; RAPPAM; accuracy assessment; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; coastal protection; coastal zone management; environmental research; habitat loss; habitat management; nature conservation; poaching; protected area; spatiotemporal analysis; vulnerability; Human resource management","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Authors would like to thank Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio) for approving this research, as well as the APACC’s management staff, especially Mr. Paulo de Sousa Jr., for being always keen to help.

However, few studies examine how well qualitative management effectiveness assessments predict conservation outcomes. We explored this question in a savanna ecosystem under high conversion pressure: the Brazilian Cerrado. We used data on avoided conversion from 2002 to 2009 in 26 protected areas, derived from comparisons of protected and unprotected sites matched for potential covariates of conversion. We tested for correlation between avoided conversion and management effectiveness scores based on RAPPAM (Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management) and found no evidence that the scores predict avoided conversion. We discuss plausible explanations including an insufficient evidence-base for management evaluation, the largely subjective nature of the assessment method and a limited emphasis on tracking results and effects of management actions. Further research of this nature can help the interpretation of management effectiveness scores and improve the assessment of protected areas performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cerrado; Conservation; Effectiveness; Management; Matching methods; Protected areas","Brazil; cerrado; conservation management; management practice; park management; performance assessment; protected area; savanna","","","","","Arcadia Fund","We thank Lilian Hangae and the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade for contributing the RAPPAM data for this study, as well as Anthony Lamb and three anonymous referees for useful comments.

However, monitoring and reporting have been inadequate to fully achieve the goals of the Convention. We argue that current reporting mechanisms, including the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM), and the R-METT reporting framework adopted at the 12th Conference of the Parties, are not well adapted to wetland systems and the objectives of the Ramsar Convention. This paper outlines one possible structure for a new reporting mechanism, explicitly focused on the Convention’s objectives of maintaining ecological character and promoting wise use within the context of sustainable development. Through these lenses, we developed a 15-question framework that would have site managers compile the most pertinent information relating to these two points quickly, including providing operational definitions, identifying allowable uses, quantifying economic benefits, reporting fundamental monitoring data, and assessing stakeholder engagement opportunities.

In order to maximize management effectiveness, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has developed the rapid assessment and prioritization of protected area management (RAPPAM) methodology for assessment of protected area management at system level based on planning, pressure and threats, inputs, processes and outputs. The RAPPAM assessment was implemented in the Turkish part of the West Lesser Caucasus for 11 PAs with 3 different categories. Two meetings were conducted with the participation of 70 people in possession of the best local knowledge about the PAs in the region. The results show that management assessment scores in all areas were rather low and this finding was similar throughout Turkey. In general, policy environment scores were remarkably below the average, showing that the importance and priority of conservation among public policies is rather low. Threats in the region were high in areas with high biological diversity. Further, semi natural processes, pollution, conversion and tourism appeared to be the greatest threat and pressure elements for the PAs in the region. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Management effectiveness; Northeast Black Sea region; Protected areas; Rapid assessment and prioritization of protected area management (RAPPAM); Turkey; Turkish Caucasus","article; biodiversity; conservation biology; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; land use; pollution monitoring; socioeconomics; Turkey (republic)","","","","","","","Albayrak F.F., Effects of protected areas on ecotourism development: Case Study in Camili Biosphere Reserve, (2010); Research on conservation and improvement possibilities of Camili and Karagol forest ecosystems in Borçka (Artvin), (1994); Implementation of RAPPAM, (2006); An ecoregional conservation plan for the Caucasus, (2006); Our forest assets, (2006); Aydin I.Z., Turker M.F., Socio-economic effects on the forest villagers of ecotourism potential: Case of Artvin-Camili Biosphere Reserve, Artvin Coruh University Faculty Forest.

This study evaluates the management effectiveness, according to the managers and management boards of 20 marine protected areas (MPAs) on the coast of Brazil, using the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) methodology. There were differences in perspectives of the managers and management boards; 8 MPAs showed a significant difference in management effectiveness values, and 11 MPAs showed a change in management effectiveness category. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the year the management board was established, and the effectiveness value provided by the council, as well as a significant difference between the effectiveness values of the MPAs under federal and state responsibility. In view of these differences, it is suggested that evaluations of management effectiveness should be carried out not only with managers, but also with management boards to reduce possible incongruities caused by the responses of only one person. © 2020.

This study aimed to analyze the management effectiveness of Cunhambebe State Park (from now on, “PEC”) in the State of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, from the perception of stakeholders and the multi-temporal analysis of land use and land cover between 1998 and 2018. We used the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management method for a participatory approach. Seventy-two indicators were used and applied to assess the perception of stakeholders related to the Advisory Council. The management effectiveness of PEC was classified as moderately satisfactory (63.41%). Indicators of “Legal security”, “Vulnerability”, “Site design and planning” and “Financial resources” revealed the weaknesses and threats of management and what should be the priority projects for better effectiveness. Through the multi-temporal analysis, we identified that the advances of pasture and urban areas are the highest pressures and threats, as perceived by stakeholders. In our case study, we provide evidence of actions that must be performed by the PEC management team. These actions must consider the weaknesses and threats presented by the SWOT analysis. Finally, we recommend some political and management measures: 1) Financial resources for the land regularization of areas overlapping with PEC, 2) Guidelines about PEC areas must be included in the Master Plans of municipalities that cover PEC limits, 3) Technical assistance to improve land management, and 4) Strengthen environmental education initiatives at all school levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atlantic forest; Conservation planning; Land use and land cover; Protected area management; RAPPAM","Biodiversity; Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; decision making; land cover; land use change; participatory approach; perception; protected area; stakeholder; article; comparative effectiveness; decision making; education; forest; human; human experiment; pasture; perception; practice guideline; Rio de Janeiro (state); temporal analysis; urban area; biodiversity; Brazil; environmental protection","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient?fico e Tecnol?gico; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, UERJ; Universidade do Porto, U.Porto; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the stakeholders of Advisory Council and the Instituto Estadual do Ambiente do Rio de Janeiro, the Graduate Program in Environmental and Forest Sciences at Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro, and the Doctoral Program in Environmental Engineering of the University of Porto.

However, it is not clear whether these important conservation tools are effectively managed, especially in the developing world where resources are limited and there are frequent conflicts with traditional resource users. An innovative approach was used to identify the most important governance, socioeconomic and biophysical variables that are associated with the management effectiveness of Brazilian MPAs. Management effectiveness data was extracted from Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Areas Management (RAPPAM), applied by World Wildlife Fund-Brazil in 2005 and 2010. This comprehensive dataset was summarized in a single management effectiveness metric and related to a set of 15 explanatory variables using generalized linear models (GLMs). An innovative multi-model averaging approach was employed to identify the most important variables relating to management effectiveness. As a result, five main indicators showed high influence on management effectiveness: 1) higher levels of monitoring/research; 2) higher investment; 3) greater human resources; 4) greater social participation, and; 5) lower levels of conflicts between users and managers. managerial effectiveness of Brazilian MPAs could be significantly improved by adopting an indicator based approach to management prioritization. Specifically, MPA managers should dedicate special attention to the highlighted factors when choosing how to allocate available resources in order to boost the overall effectiveness of their protected area. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Conflict resolution; Effectiveness evaluation; Management effectiveness; Rapid assessment; Socioecological systems","Brazil; conflict management; data set; developing world; marine park; nature conservation; prioritization","","","","","Brazilian Innovation Agency; State Funding Agency of Alagoas; VSB, (303469/2013-7); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Alagoas, FAPEAL, (20110908-006-0018-0028); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (310953/2014-6); Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP, (01.10.0668.00, 01.10.0770.02); Novo Nordisk Fonden, NNF, (306624/2014-1)","The authors would like to thank CAPES/PPG-DIBICT fellowship, the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development – CNPq for funding support to RJL Grant #310953/2014-6, VSB Grant #303469/2013-7 and NNF Grant #306624/2014-1 and the grants from State Funding Agency of Alagoas (FAPEAL) # 20110908-006-0018-0028, and Brazilian Innovation Agency (FINEP) #01.10.0770.02 and #01.10.0668.00.

With applications in more than 50 countries, the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) method is arguably the tool used most widely to assist such prioritization. The extent to which its indicators provide useful measures of a protected area's capacity to achieve its conservation objectives, however, has seldom been subject to empirical scrutiny. We use a rich spatial dataset and time series data from 66 forest protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon to examine whether RAPPAM scores are associated with success in avoiding deforestation. We find no statistically significant association between avoided deforestation and indicators that reflect preferential targets of conservation investments, including budget, staff, equipment, management plans and stakeholder collaboration. Instead, we find that the absence of unsettled land tenure conflicts is consistently associated strongly with success in reducing deforestation pressures. Our results underscore the importance of tracking and resolving land tenure in protected area management, and lead us to call for more rigorous assessments of existing strategies for assessing and prioritizing management interventions in protected areas. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Amazon rainforest; avoided deforestation; Brazil; management effectiveness; prioritization; protected areas; RAPPAM","Brazil; Conservation; Deforestation; Amazonia; Brazil; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Amazon rain forest; Brazil; Management effectiveness; Prioritization; Protected areas; RAPPAM; data set; deforestation; environmental indicator; environmental management; environmental planning; investment; land tenure; management practice; prioritization; protected area; rainforest; resource allocation; stakeholder; time series analysis; Conservation","","","","","","","Andam K.S., Ferraro P.J., Pfaff A., Sanchez-Azofeifa G.A., Robalino J.A., Measuring the effectiveness of protected area networks in reducing deforestation, Proc.

However, these assessments are frequently conducted mainly at the internal management level, without input from the local communities that implicitly influence the resources of the protected areas. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of three protected areas in Ghana-Kogyae Strict Nature Reserve, Gbele Resource Reserve, and Kalakpa Resource Reserve-using the Rapid Assessment and Prioritisation of Protected Areas Management assessment tool. The study included workshops with park managers and representatives from local communities, district assemblies, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Poaching, settlements, agricultural encroachment, poverty in nearby communities, and bush fires were identified as common pressures to all the assessed protected areas. The degree of these pressures was influenced by little or no funding, poor community relations, lack of staff and research, and natural resource inventories in the protected areas. Our study highlights the priority of remedial actions that are urgently needed to preserve the protected area resources. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Developing and improving the relationship between the PA authorities and local communities is vital to achieving the PA’s conservation goals. Participatory management is, therefore, paramount in the management of the PAs (Kolahi et al. 2013). Collaborative management will protect local communities’ rights and interests and focus on a management body that represents all stakeholders equitably. Generally, the planning element in the RAPPAM methodology has received the highest score in most PAs assessed around the world, including for instance those in Russia (Tyrlyshkin et al. 2003), China (Diqiang et al. 2003), and Turkey (Kurdoğlu and Çokçaliskan 2011). In terms of inputs, the highest scores for Gbele was as a result of external funding from the Sustainable Land and Water Management Project (SLWMP) sponsored by the World Bank and Global Environmental Facility, which began in 2011 and ends in 2020. Kalakpa, which had the lowest management input scores, has insufficient funds, and consequently, extremely inadequate staff facilities and equipment and poor visitor facilities. The primary sources of funds for PAs in Ghana are the Government funds, the internally generated funds from the Forestry Commission of Ghana, and the contributions by the donor agencies/governments. Insufficient funding often creates a shortfall that is extremely difficult to overcome, even when PAs have well-trained and highly motivated staff. According to officials of the Wildlife Division, PAs have approximately 55-60% of the staff needed for effective management. Lack of staff, funding, inadequate facilities, and equipment are some of the causes of poor management in PAs at a global level (Leverington et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Kolahi et al. 2013; López-Rodrígueza and Rosado 2017).","Afriyie J.O., Asare M.O., Osei-Mensah J., Hejcmanova P., Evaluation of long-Term law enforcement monitoring in a West African protected area; Anderson A., Jenkins C., Applying nature's design: corridors as a Strategy for biodiversity conservation, (2006); Amaja L.G., Feyssa D.H., Gutema T.M., Assessment of types of damage and causes of human-wildlife conflict in Gera district, southwestern Ethiopia, Journal of Ecology and the Natural Environment, 8, 5, pp. 49-54, (2016); Asante F.A., Amuakwah-Mensah F., Climate change and variability in Ghana: stocktaking, Climate, 3, 1, pp. 78-99, (2015); Ayivor J.S., Ntiamoa-Baidu Y., Assessing the socio-economic stressors of Ghana's only Strict Nature Reserve-Kogyae, Parks, 21, 2, pp. 85-100, (2015); Bitty E.A., Bi S.G., Bene J-CK., Kouassi P.K., McGraw W.S., Cocoa farming and primate extirpation inside Cote d'Ivoire's protected areas, Tropical Conservation Science, 8, 1, pp. 95-113, (2015); Bouko B.S., Dossou P.J., Amadou B., Sinsin B., Exploitation des ressources biologiques et dynamique de la foret classee de la Mekrou au Benin, European Scientific Journal, 12, 36, pp. 228-244, (2016); Caillault S., Le feu, la brousse et la savane Modélisation spatiale de la dynamique des paysages soudaniens (Burkina Faso), (2011); Craigie I.D., Baillie J.E.M., Balmford A., Carbone C., Collen B., Green R.E., Hutton J.M., Large mammal population declines in Africa's protected areas, Biological Conservation, 143, 9, pp. 2221-2228, (2010); Cook C.N., Hockings M., Opportunities for improving the rigor of management effectiveness evaluations in protected areas, Conservation Letters, 4, 2011, pp. 372-382, (2011); Danquah E., Importance of protected areas for carnivore conservation in western Ghana, Sustainable utilization and management of natural resources in the era of climate change, (2015); de Haan C., Steinfeld, Blackburn H., Livestock and the environment: finding a balance, (1997); Diallo H., Bamba I., Barima Y.S.S., Visser M., Ballo A., Mama A., Vranken I., Et al., Effets combinés du climat et des pressions anthropiques sur la dynamique évolutive de la végétation d'une zone protégée du Mali (Réserve de Fina, Boucle du Baoulé), Science et Changements Planétaires/Sécheresse, 22, pp. 97-107, (2011); Dumenu W.K., Bandoh W.N., Exploitation of African Rosewood (Pterocarpus erinaceus) in Ghana: A situation analysis, Ghana Journal of Forestry, 32, 2016, pp. 1-15, (2016); Diqiang L., Jianhua Z., Ke D., Bo W., Chunquan Z., China case study: An assessment of the management effectiveness of protected areas in the forests of the Upper Yangtze Ecoregion of China, (2003); Ghana's second national communication (GSNC) to the UNFCCC, (2011); The Rosewood racket: China's billion dollar illegal timber trade and the devastation of Nigeria's forests, (2017); Ervin J., Rapid assessment and prioritization of protected area management effectiveness in four countries, Bioscience, 53, 9, pp. 833-841, (2003); Ervin J., Rapid assessment and prioritization of protected area management (RAPPAM) methodology, (2003); Foxcroft L.C., Pysek P., Richardson D.M., Genovesi P., Plant invasions in protected areas: patterns, problems, and challenges, (2013); Foxcroft L.C., Witt A., Lotter W.D., Icons in peril: invasive alien plants in African protected areas, Plant invasions in protected areas: Patterns, problems, and challenges, (2013); Frank B., Human-wildlife conflicts and the need to include tolerance and coexistence: An introductory comment, Society and Natural Resources, 29, 6, pp. 738-743, (2016); Gonedele S., Kone I., Bitty E.A., Bene J.C., Akpatou B., Zinner D., Distribution and conservation status of catarrhine primates in Côte d'Ivoire (West Africa), Folia Primatology, 83, 1, pp. 11-23, (2012); Population census-1984, (1984); 2010 Population and housing census of Ghana, (2014); The Ghana poverty and inequality report using the 6th Living Standards Survey, (2016); Goodman P., Protected area management effectiveness assessment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, (2003); Illegal logging and trade of rosewood: case study of Senegambia, (2015); Larger than elephants: inputs for an EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa-regional analysis, (2016); Parks and reserves of Ghana: Management effectiveness assessment of protected areas, (2010); Invasive plants affecting protected areas of West Africa.

Most of the sites are, however, poorly managed as resource exploitation by fringe communities and low government funding, among other things, threaten their management effectiveness. We used the World Commission on Protected Areas framework for designing management effectiveness evaluation systems, with the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Areas Management (RAPPAM) methodology as a tool, to evaluate six components of the management cycle at six sites in Ghana for their management effectiveness. We examined the robustness of RAPPAM as an evaluation tool in the African context. The results showed that most of the sites evaluated are vulnerable and exposed to various degrees of pressure and threats, including poverty in the nearby communities, adjacent land-use and encroachment. On RAPPAM, we noted that apart from inconsistencies in some of the assessment scores due to the biases associated with the self-assessment approach of the methodology, the management effectiveness framework places little emphasis on financing and community participation, though both play major roles in the management process. We proposed a modification of the framework within the African context, to address effectively the underlying courses of pressure and threats facing Ghana’s protected areas. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community participation; financing; Ghana; management effectiveness evaluation; Protected areas; Volta Basin","","","","","","","","Abrams R.W., Anwana E.D., Ormsby A., Dovie D.B.K., Ajagbe A., Abrams A., Integrating top-down with bottom-up conservation policy in Africa, Conservation Biology, 23, 4, pp. 799-804, (2009); Ayivor J.S., Gordon C., Ntiamoa-Baidu Y., Protected area management and livelihood conflicts in Ghana: A case study of Digya National Park, Parks, 19, 1, pp. 37-50, (2013); Ayivor J.S., Ntiamoa-Baidu Y., Assessing the socio-economic stressors of Ghana’s only Strict nature reserve: Kogyae, Parks, 21, 2, pp. 87-101, (2015); Ayivor J.S., Ofori B.D., Nyametso J.K., Effectiveness of protected area financing as a management tool.

That is why maintaining species’ diversity and preventing the destruction of habitats in protected areas has been of great interest. Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management methodology is one of the most common methods of management effectiveness assessment and is used as a tool for managers and decision-makers of protected areas. Recently, the biodiversity and sustainability of wildlife populations, as well as preserving the integrity of protected areas in the Khuzestan province, have been at risk due to several factors; therefore, the evaluation of management effectiveness in these areas is necessary. The studied areas in this research are protected areas in Khuzestan province, with a history of more than 5 years of management. The results of this study show that Dez, a protected area with the highest points in the planning (38.5), has the highest score in management effectiveness (128.78). Also, Shimbar, a protected area with the lowest score (11), has the lowest score of management effectiveness (64.66) among the other areas. The overall management level of the protected areas in the Khuzestan province is at the low-intermediate managerial level compared to the global average. Therefore, it is necessary to change the policies and management of these areas. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conservation; Effectiveness; Iran; Monitoring; PA management; RAPPAM","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Iran; Khuzestan; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Managers; Monitoring; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Effectiveness; Iran; Khuzestan provinces; Management effectiveness; Management level; Protected area management; RAPPAM; Wildlife populations; biodiversity; conservation management; environmental management; environmental monitoring; protected area; wild population; article; biodiversity; comparative effectiveness; human; Iran; manager; monitoring; wildlife; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; Iran; procedures; Decision making","","","","","","","Addison P.F., Flander L.B., Cook C.N., Are we missing the boat?

The assessment of the management effectiveness provides examples to improve the management of these areas. Thus, this study assessed the management effectiveness of 11 MPAs with reef environments in the coast of Brazil, in the period of 10 years (2005, 2010, and 2015), through the method of Rapid Assessment and Priorization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM). The questionnaire was also used to address the pressure (activities that affect the MPA in the last 5 years) and threats (activities that can potentially affect the MPA in the next 5 years. From the 11 MPAs assessed, the highest values of pressures and threats were obtained for two areas in the year of 2005 and four areas in 2015 (above 35%). The mean management effectiveness between 2005 and 2015 increased from 55.6% (±8.2) in 2005 to 60% (±11.5) in 2015. However, even with this increase, the mean effectiveness of some MPAs is still below the limit considered ideal for satisfactory management (<40%), and the number of MPAs with good management (>60%) has not changed over time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coral reef; MPAs; Pressures; RAPPAM; Threats","Brazil; Anthozoa; Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental protection; Pressure; Reefs; Coral reef; Management effectiveness; Marine protected area; MPAs; Protected area management; RAPPAM; Temporal assessment; Threats; assessment method; biodiversity; coastal zone; conservation management; coral reef; prioritization; protected area; questionnaire survey; temporal analysis; Environmental management","","","","","","","Anderson M.J., A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance, Austral Ecol., 26, 1, pp. 32-46, (2001); Aronson R.B., Precht W.F., Conservation, precaution, and caribbean reefs, Coral Reefs, 25, 3, pp. 441-450, (2006); Asoh K., Yoshikawa T., Kosaki R., Marschall E.A., Damage to cauliflower coral by monofilament fishing lines in Hawaii, Conserv.

A case study was conducted at Sagarmatha National Park, Nepal from 2002–2016 to examine some buffer zone initiatives. Methods: Focus group discussions (n = 7), key informant interviews (n = 14), and field observations were performed in accordance with the IUCN Framework for Assessing Management Effectiveness of Protected Areas 2006 and WWF´s Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management 2006. Results: A total of 99 buffer zone activities were identified, including a variety of construction activities such as hydroelectric projects, trails, schools, and monasteries. Park funds were allocated mainly for community development and social welfare (42%), and less on conservation and conflict management (22%). For example, traditional “Nawa” animal rearing practices, feral dog control, and mitigation of wildlife damages to crops and livestock were overlooked. Conclusion: Support gained from the buffer zone program to address livelihoods of needy households who suffer from wildlife damages was lacking, despite legal provisions for compensation (e.g. crop damages caused by jharal). This should not occur at the expense of wildlife conservation and if it does, it will diminish the original intent of buffer zones. Implications for Conservation: Although most of the local communities were positive about buffer zone programs and activities, there was a dire need to incorporate “Nawa” practices, wildlife damage compensation schemes, and feral dog controls. This study suggests to update policies that focus on conflict management. © The Author(s) 2022.","Buffer zone contribution; conservation; human-wildlife conflicts; Mount Everest; national parks; tourism","","","","","","Park and Buffer Zone Management Committee","We are thankful to the local communities of Sagarmatha National Park who agreed to participate in this study.
