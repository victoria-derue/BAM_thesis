abstract={Human-wildlife conflict affects the social-ecological systems essential for sustainable development. In human-dominated landscapes, effective management necessitates context-specific strategies that promote workable coexistence. This present study evaluates community perspectives on human-wildlife conflict management strategies through Importance-Performance Analysis in Chitwan National Park, Nepal. As a cost-effective and user-friendly tool, Importance-Performance Analysis helps protected area managers prioritize strategies and make informed decisions. Our findings reveal eight management strategies with significant importance-performance gaps, suggesting that park management is falling short in meeting both farmers’ and non-farmers’ needs. The graphical representation of Importance-Performance Analysis matrix visually identifies three high priority strategies—enhanced livelihood diversification skills, promotion of alternative livelihoods, and fast-tracked compensation schemes—that demand immediate action. The ANOVA results show varying perspectives between farmers and non-farmers across the park's four management sectors (Kasara, Sauraha, Madi, and Amaltari), regarding the importance and performance of management strategies. This study demonstrates that Importance-Performance Analysis can be effectively adapted by protected area managers to evaluate and enhance management effectiveness from stakeholders’ perspectives, thereby balancing biodiversity conservation with community well-being and advancing the global goal of ‘living in harmony with nature’. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={The existing methodologies to measure management effectiveness of protected area have often been focus on identifying weaknesses and strengths to set priorities in terms of policy intervention, resource distribution and adaptive management. It is not adequately captured the extent of protected area sustainability as a conservation site even though management effectiveness is influenced by the interaction of environment, socioeconomics and governance, which are pillars of sustainability. Thus, the objective of this study was to propose a methodology based on sustainability pillar indicators to evaluate management effectiveness, using three protected areas in Peninsular Malaysia as case studies: Sungai Dusun, Bukit Kutu and Klang Gate wildlife reserves. In this study, a questionnaire survey was used to evaluate the management effectiveness of the study sites. The evaluation framework of the questionnaire was based on six components of management effectiveness and indicators from three sustainability pillars or aspects: environment, socioeconomics and governance. Respondents of the survey consisted of local residents in each study site and management staff involved in the management of the protected areas. Each indicator from different aspects of evaluation was assigned a selected parameter to be rated by the respondents from ‘1’ (strongly disagree) to ‘5’ (strongly agree). Based on the rating values the percentage of optimum value was calculated to determine the overall management rating for each study site which interpreted according to five management levels from ‘unsatisfactory’ to ‘very satisfactory’. The percentage of optimum values revealed that the environment and governance aspects of all study sites had moderately satisfactory while for socioeconomic only Klang Gate had moderately satisfactory but satisfactory for Bukit Kutu and Sungai Dusun. The overall percentage of optimum revealed that the management effectiveness level of all reserves was moderately satisfactory. However, Sungai Dusun had the highest percentage of optimum (71.3%), followed by Bukit Kutu (67.7%) and Klang Gate (66.5%). In conclusion, the sustainability level of the reserves is still functioning as intended despite deficiencies especially in governance aspect. Thus, the proposed methodology is simple and has adoptable way to measure both management effectiveness and capture the sustainability of the protected areas. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Nature-based solutions to ecological challenges have continued to draw significant attention, and are connected to the increased establishment of protected areas as a means for climate and ecological crisis mitigation. This study presents an innovative approach that combines spatial and statistical analysis of land cover change and drivers to evaluate land use management and effectiveness of 22 designated protected areas (PAs) across the tropical coastal regions of sub-Saharan Africa. While the results provided insight into land use management and conservation priorities, it highlighted (1) the use of these protected areas for food production is prevalent, irrespective of its designation. Nevertheless, there is evidence of a decline in cropland in some of the protected areas, suggesting a shift in policy towards conservation land use. (2) The occurrence of forest loss suggests that conservation is weak in most of the protected areas, while wetland conservation efforts are stronger due to their land cover expansion. (3) Population density (human factor) is the most significant driver of land cover change in these protected areas, followed by elevation (natural environment), precipitation (climate), nighttime light (socio-economic), and slope (natural environment). (4) In terms of Ecosystem value, only 15 of the 22 protected areas exhibited an increase in their total ecosystem service value according to land cover change, indicating sustainable land use and measures effectiveness in these protected areas. However, based on an individual land cover assessment, most protected areas showed signs of loss, especially in forests. Given the projected population growth in Africa, a regular assessment of protected areas should be initiated to enable effective and timely management decisions. Additionally, policies to improve the management effectiveness of African protected areas through funding should be a top priority, while taking into consideration the livelihoods of the indigenous people in the area in order to find a sustainable balance. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract={We assessed protected area management effectiveness and identified attributes that limit the effectiveness of 21 protected areas in the State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Of these, we assessed 10 areas under state-level administration for which a standardised assessment had not previously been conducted. For the 11 protected areas under federal administration, we obtained assessment data from the government. The protected areas were contrasted regarding the administration level and a list of attributes that could result in differences in management effectiveness between areas. We examined the relationship between protected areas’ attributes and mean effectiveness using linear models. The same attributes were also related to management elements, namely context, planning, inputs, processes and outputs, using redundancy analysis. Management effectiveness and scores of management elements were found to be lower for areas either with unresolved land tenure, lacking management plans or updated ones, those under many pressures and threats, or those under state-level administration. Overall, we suggest that federal protected areas do better in at least these attributes or a combination of attributes not well-captured by single indicators than state-level protected areas. Reassessments should be regularly carried out across administration levels in order to effectively flag a barrier, clear it, and identify the next one to be tackled. © 2024, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={In 2014, the Galapagos National Park Directorate, sponsored by various international non-governmental organizations, initiated a comprehensive marine and terrestrial spatial planning process to improve the management effectiveness of Galapagos’ protected areas. This effort aimed to reconfigure management areas by expanding or redistributing no-take zones to protect Key Biodiversity Areas and ensure the conservation of at least 30% of terrestrial and marine ecosystems in the Galapagos. However, this process encountered significant challenges, notably the erosion of fishers' trust following the implementation of a "Marine Sanctuary". This top-down decision resulted in socio-political tension, compelling the Ecuadorian government to delay the implementation of the new marine zoning until there was conclusive scientific data on its socio-economic impact on local small-scale fishers’ livelihoods. This paper examines the achievements and shortcomings of the Galapagos zoning update process, highlighting the successful integration of scientific zoning criteria and the enhanced protection of critical biodiversity areas, together with the reduced support from fishers and legal disputes. To move forward, we recommended a bottom-up approach centered on rebuilding trust among the fishing community via innovative engagement strategies and the introduction of market incentives to promote sustainable practices. Assessing the long-term impact of no-take zones is essential for refining management approaches. Additionally, the application of cutting-edge technology within an adaptive co-management model is recommended to improve fisheries and ecological data gathering and analysis, facilitating proactive and well-informed management decisions. Our suggestions aim to reconcile conservation objectives with the needs and aspirations of the local communities in this iconic archipelago. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract={The conversion of natural environments to artificial surfaces has significant irreversible impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The European Union (EU) has set ambitious goals to combat land artificialisation, including achieving “no net land take” by 2050. It also plans to expand its network of protected areas, including the Natura 2000 (N2K) sites, to 30 % of its area by 2030. However, studies have shown that land artificialisation continues to occur even within N2K sites. It has not yet been examined, though, which habitats are most affected. To address this gap, we used a high-resolution spatial layer of the EU's habitats and layers showing impervious surfaces across the EU to quantify and compare the current levels of artificial surfaces within each habitat inside and outside N2K sites. We also compared the changes in impervious surfaces between 2012 and 2015 and 2015–2018. We found that the total extent of impervious surfaces, and their rates of change, were lower within the N2K sites for all habitats examined. However, patterns varied: coastal habitats, grasslands, and agricultural habitats had higher levels of artificial surfaces than others, even within N2K sites. Our findings indicate that although the planned expansion of the N2K network can help mitigate the artificialisation of threatened habitats, N2K sites do not entirely halt land conversion. Member States should further improve the management effectiveness of NK2 sites and promote financial and policy instruments addressing land artificialisation, e.g., through land recycling, to safeguard vulnerable habitats and achieve the EU's conservation objectives. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools; however, many fail to achieve their full potential because of design and management deficiencies. Evaluating MPA management effectiveness (ME) is essential for identifying deficiency issues in conservations and guiding improvements. This study established an indicator-based framework to evaluate ME tailored to Taiwan's MPAs through literature reviews, expert consultations, and stakeholder workshops. We applied 28 indicators to the ME evaluation of 30 fishery conservation zones (FCZs), utilizing semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, questionnaires, analysis of ecological reports, and on-site visits. Only two MPAs were rated as highly effective; most were poorly managed, with deficiencies in ecological monitoring, enforcement, and stakeholder participation. A case study combined a quantitative ME evaluation with collaborative action research involving governments, scientists, and communities to address issues and accelerate enhancements in the Qimei FCZ. Initial low scores prompted workshops to engage stakeholders in identifying problems such as incorrect boundaries, lack of ecological data, and enforcement challenges. This led to boundary revisions, citizen scientist training, and proposals for no-take zones to improve enforcement. The evaluation revealed management deficiencies in Taiwan's MPAs, while action research catalyzed solutions through participative processes. Region-specific indicator frameworks aligned with local priorities are vital for optimizing MPA benefits. This study provides an exemplary quantitative–qualitative approach, coupling evidence-based evaluations and collaborative action research to improve MPA management. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract={Although Brazil has one of the world’s largest systems of protected areas, we do not know to what extent its marine protected areas (MPAs) are functioning as repositories of threatened species. Here we synthesized governmental and scientific information on the country's 75 federal MPAs to assess whether their size, age, protection group, visitation and management effectiveness affect the number of threatened animal species present within their boundaries. The MPAs harbored 133 threatened species, which corresponds to 78.2% of the 170 threatened marine animal species listed for the country. On average, there were 10.1 threatened species per MPA (varying from 1 to 48), but 13 MPAs did not report any. As expected, the number of threatened species was greater in no-take, larger, and older MPAs with management plan. The MPA effectiveness index averaged 0.55 (0.43–0.74), indicating moderate effectiveness for the entire federal system. The level of management effectiveness in 2022 and the visitation accumulated between 2012 and 2021 did not significantly affect the number of threatened species. Our results demonstrate that Brazilian MPAs do serve as repositories for threatened animal species, but reveal serious bottlenecks in the management of official databases, dissemination of information to society, and biodiversity inventory and monitoring. We recommend (i) improvements in working conditions for MPA officials; (ii) advances in data management and publicization; (iii) partnerships of MPA managers with universities, research institutions, and non-governmental organizations; and (iv) the development of a broad, long-term biodiversity monitoring program. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},

abstract={Protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity, natural habitats, ecosystem services and cultural values. Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

abstract={Here we provide evidence, along an 8-year period time-series based on multifaceted data from a Mediterranean marine protected area (MPA), whether protection can tackle invasive and range expanding herbivore fishes, and their effects on the algal resource availability, taking into account the population trends of predatory fishes, fisheries catches of herbivore fishes and sea surface temperature (SST) through time. Our findings pointed out that an ineffective in restoring top-down control process MPA may facilitate, rather than alleviate, the sudden and enduring population burst of invasive and range-expanding herbivorous fishes at tipping points of abrupt change. This subsequently results in the deterioration of rocky reef habitats and the depletion of algal resources, with the tipping points of abrupt change for algal and herbivore fish species not overlapping chronologically. As sea temperature increases, ineffective or recently established MPAs may inadvertently facilitate the proliferation of invasive and range-expanding species, posing a significant challenge to management effectiveness and conservation objectives. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ecological connectivity among Protected Areas (PAs) is essential to improve biodiversity conservation and management effectiveness under global change. In Colombia, developing strategic plans and locating spatial priorities for PA connectivity is fundamental for conserving its extraordinary bird diversity in the face of multiple threats, including deforestation and climate change. Here, we develop a multispecies bird connectivity model to identify critical sites for preserving and enhancing the ecological connections among PAs in Colombia. We focused our analyses on 26 forest-dependent bird species, determining their potential suitable habitat across Colombia using species distribution models and climatic variables. Expert knowledge guided the construction of movement resistance surfaces across these distributions to describe how different land covers impede or facilitate species movement. Using these inputs, we mapped Least-Cost Corridors (LCCs) connecting national and subnational PAs meeting the area requirements for the selected species. Additionally, we used circuit and least-cost models to locate conservation priorities and restoration opportunities, estimating the potential connectivity gains through the Equivalent Connected Area (ECA) index. We aggregated individual species results to create multispecies composite maps highlighting spatial agreements for corridors, priority conservation areas, and restoration opportunities. We found 581,531 km2 belonging to corridors among PAs for all focal species. Priority sites for movement within corridors covered 212,551 km2 and were predominantly located across Andean and Amazonian forests. Restoration opportunities covered 79,203 km2 and were concentrated in agricultural lands of the Andes and Caribbean regions. Restoring these areas could increase the national forest cover by 7% and connectivity by 14%. Our results provide a national-level assessment of functional connectivity priorities to maintain and improve the interconnections among PAs in Colombia. This assessment could guide efforts related to conservation, restoration, and implementation of management tools that facilitate the movement of native species across transformed lands. These actions are crucial to meet the targets outlined in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework to achieve well-connected systems of PAs during this decade and until 2050. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract={Although there are more than 270,000 protected areas worldwide, there is currently little data on their protection and management effectiveness. As a kind of protected area, natural world heritage (WH) sites are small but represent some of the most important natural landscapes, covering a very large area. But natural WH is threatened by climate change, natural disasters and human activities. Therefore, to achieve the sustainable development of WH sites, it is very important to analyze the management status of WH sites. Based on this, the study extracts inspiration from Enhancing our Heritage Toolkit: Assessing management effectiveness of natural World Heritage sites. An assessment system of the management effectiveness (ME) of natural WH sites has been established, which has three dimensions (including management foundation, management measures, and management performances) and 21 indexes. The reliability and validity of the index system are tested using the exploratory factor analysis method, and the results show that the index system has good reliability and validity. Then principal component analysis and comprehensive assessment methods are used to analyze the ME of the Fanjingshan WH site. The results show that the management effectiveness of the Fanjingshan WH Site is relatively excellent, but it still faces challenges from tourism development and community participation. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) are a commonly used strategy to confront forest conversion and biodiversity loss. Although determining drivers of forest loss is central to conservation success, understanding of them is limited by conventional modeling assumptions. We used random forest regression to evaluate potential drivers of deforestation in PAs in Mexico, while accounting for nonlinear relationships and higher order interactions underlying deforestation processes. Socioeconomic drivers (e.g., road density, human population density) and underlying biophysical conditions (e.g., precipitation, distance to water, elevation, slope) were stronger predictors of forest loss than PA characteristics, such as age, type, and management effectiveness. Within PA characteristics, variables reflecting collaborative and equitable management and PA size were the strongest predictors of forest loss, albeit with less explanatory power than socioeconomic and biophysical variables. In contrast to previously used methods, which typically have been based on the assumption of linear relationships, we found that the associations between most predictors and forest loss are nonlinear. Our results can inform decisions on the allocation of PA resources by strengthening management in PAs with the highest risk of deforestation and help preemptively protect key biodiversity areas that may be vulnerable to deforestation in the future. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={Well-resourced marine protected areas (MPA) are better managed, leading to improved ecological outcomes. Tourism is often cited as an important source of financial support for MPA management, yet it is unclear whether funding from visitor entry fees improves the effectiveness of the world's MPAs. Here we ask whether fees to enter MPAs associate with enhanced fish biomass, a key ecological goal of many MPAs, and whether relations exist among entry fees and management effectiveness. In an analysis of 86 MPAs, we found entry fees were associated with greater fish biomass when compared to parks without entry fees, but only for parks with lower scores for management effectiveness. A global assessment of management survey responses from 214 MPAs suggested the hypothesis that MPA entry fees benefit budget security and staff capacity to carry out critical management activities. Together, the results suggest a mechanism whereby entry fees support greater capacity to educate parks users on rules and enforce those rules. Future work should look at the details of MPA budgets to unravel the relationship between funding, management activities and ecological outcomes. Dependency on tourism also comes with the important implication that declines in tourism caused by socio-economic shocks and geopolitical events may have affected the financial security and therefore possibly the ecological effectiveness of MPAs. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract={While few studies have examined the situation of core areas in a large and integrated protected area, the present study targeted and evaluated the management effectiveness of the Mt. Huangzui and Lujiaokeng Ecological Protected Areas in Yangmingshan National Park, Taiwan, using the Enhancing our Heritage (EoH) toolkit as a holistic and systematic approach. During 2016–17, data and information were gathered through literature review, interviews, and focus groups. In total, 69 interviews were conducted and 14 workshops were held, creating 132 field records. The study results showed that the current wilderness paradigm could not achieve good results for the management of core areas in Yangmingshan National Park. Accordingly, we strongly recommended specific management plans or plan chapters for both sites. Poor local participation was another major deficiency. Many of the same weaknesses were also identified in Forestry Bureau Protected Areas. Located near urban areas, both of the Ecological Protected Areas in Yangmingshan National Park faced similar types of threat/pressure from invasive/alien species, recreational activities, and problematic native species. The study results further showed that the core area of a protected area could be holistically reviewed through management effectiveness evaluation. However, without the participation of stakeholders, even experienced professional park officers may be found to have group blind spots through such evaluations. This study also found the accumulation of sufficient data support to be a key prerequisite for implementing EoH. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={According to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) post-2020 global biodiversity framework, marine conservation activities aiming solely at area coverage are insufficient; thus, a persistent effort is required to establish effective marine protected areas (MPAs). Despite the fact that the number of MPAs has expanded dramatically over time, their management effectiveness still needs to improve, particularly in developing nations. Hence, this study was conducted to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the current state of Indonesian MPAs in meeting the Aichi targets. The government's investigative reports served as the foundation for the quantitative research, while a government-led interview-based survey conducted across 61 Indonesian locations served as the basis for the qualitative study. The findings showed that although the present Indonesian MPAs were at the stage of meeting the national target of 10 % coverage, it was anticipated that they would fall short of the new 30 % worldwide target by 2030. Although 61 % and 39 % of the research sites were managed at a minimal and optimal level, respectively, the evaluation of the management effectiveness of the MPAs in Indonesia indicates that none of the sites were sustainably managed. Lack of funding due to a need for infrastructure, facilities, and human resources was the main problem impeding management effectiveness. Based on the study's findings, it is recommended that the nation's biodiversity targets be designed to focus more on the development and oversight of the current MPA management and provide a perceptive policy response concerning the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ramsar Sites, wetlands of international importance, are an international category of protected wetland areas recognized under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Protected areas around the world are not achieving the conservation objectives for which they were established, often due to a lack in effective management practices. Hence, protected area management effectiveness and its assessments are crucial elements of achieving responsive and pro-active management. Ramsar Sites that are not recognized as a protected area under the national park and wildlife conservation act in Nepal are often ignored for such assessments and receive little attention in terms of conservation and management. This study aimed to fill this gap by assessing Jagadishpur Reservoir Ramsar Site, which falls into the above category. The Ramsar Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool was used to assess the management effectiveness. Transformed into the global standard reporting format, the overall management effectiveness was 0.27 on a 0 to 1 scale. This score is considered to be in an inadequate range, requiring significant conservation intervention from government with support from conservation partners. This first assessment of Ramsar Site outside of protected area in Nepal and its comparison to global and European regional-level assessments provides the benchmark for future evaluation to track progress in management effectiveness. In conclusion, Ramsar Sites outside formally protected areas are often neglected and intermittent projects, and ad hoc implementation of small-scale activities seems inadequate to improve management effectiveness. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Ethnobotanical data, a vital component of a thorough examination of a protected area that aids in planning for management efforts and strategies for biodiversity conservation, is rarely employed because of its rarity or absence in Northern Negros Natural Park’s (NNNP) database. This study aims to [1] determine the plant and other forest bioresource utilization of the local communities in NNNP, [2] assess the threats to the park and its biodiversity due to the utilization of bioresources, and [3] evaluate the Institutional Management Regime for NNNP. The data was gathered using focus groups, key informant interviews, and household surveys. For the secondary data, information was also accessed from the Office of the Protected Area Superintendent and local government units. One hundred thirteen (113) species are used for food (26%), ornamental (24%), herbal or medicinal value (19%), construction (12%), commercial (9%), charcoal and fuel wood (8%), and craft (3%) based on data collected from 643 families in the 11 cities and municipalities that make up the protected area. Housing construction, settlement, and the production of annual and non-perennial timber crops were all noted as major threats identified in the park. According to the review of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), the “context” and “planning” components were the strengths of the protected area employing the management rating of 64 and 53.8%, respectively. The Republic Act No. 11038, commonly known as the Expanded National Integrated Protected Area System (ENIPAS), is the sole unambiguous law that governs bioresource harvesting in protected areas. In addition, policies imposed by cooperatives and villages were used to control the usage and harvesting of bioresources. These findings gave us a crucial socioeconomic and institutional understanding of the landscape, preparing us to make interventions and create management plans to deal with problems involving the use of bioresources in the protected area. © 2023, Department of Science and Technology.

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) that are not effectively managed will not contribute meaningfully to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3, which aims to ensure that a minimum of 30 per cent of terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine areas are effectively conserved and managed. Our study examined the monitoring and evaluation of protected area management effectiveness (PAME) as part of an adaptive management process in the Kruger to Canyons (K2C) Biosphere Region in South Africa. Our mixed methods approach, using online questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups, revealed that most PA managers in the network were familiar with the concept of adaptive management. The most widely used PAME evaluation tool used in the region was the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT). Some PAs did not use a formal tool but gathered scientific data using methods such as game counts and vegetation surveys to judge management effectiveness. Additionally, several managers that did not use a formal tool mentioned that they were constrained by time, staff capacity or budget. The introduction of a simpler tool for managers that are time- or resource-constrained or who are working in a newly declared or in-process PA may improve PAME evaluation within the network. We suggest that there is a need for improved communication, co-learning, and information sharing regarding PAME evaluation tools. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Clearly, establishing protected areas is a critical element of protecting and preserving our global biodiversity but the effective management of these protected areas to meet conservation goals is equally critical to this success. Many protected area management effectiveness (PAME) methodologies have evolved over the last several decades, and these efforts have been very important for determining resource adequacy and effectiveness of organizational level management practices. However, there remains much needed discussion of how protected area managers can improve management effectiveness since several meta-analyses have estimated that “only 20–50% of protected areas assessed were found to be effectively managed”. The purpose of this paper is to acknowledge the advancements made by the PAME movement in assessing the effectiveness of protected area management, but also the benefit of supplemental workforce capacity assessments to address some of the issues raised through the PAME analysis. We propose a more comprehensive model of protected area effectiveness that couples the strengths of PAME studies with the diagnostic value of competence-based analyses of workforce capacity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The decline in economic activities and tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the pressure on the environment and protected area (PA) systems to some extent. However, the financial losses within nature-based tourism due to travel restrictions and park closures will negatively impact tourism income-dependent PAs' management effectiveness. This exploratory study incorporates a risk-assessment framework to investigate and provide first insights into the pandemic's influence on the delivery of management outputs in Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia. Although in 2020, this PA faced a 75% decline in overall revenue compared to the year before, analysis suggests that, in the short term, conservation-related outputs are least affected. Visitor management and PA efforts to support the local community's sustainable development are the most severely impacted first-order outputs. Third-order nature-based tourism-related outputs face average to high risks. This study's risk-assessment framework provides a starting point for a post-pandemic reassessment of the delivery of PA management outputs and decision-making about output prioritisation and resource allocation. Results suggest several new avenues for research. Management implications: Post-pandemic recovery of PA requires prioritisation risk framework to identify specific objectives that should be addressed first and which require additional effort or funding. Facing a crisis PA will allocate financial resources in a way that sustains primary functions such as conservation until negative trends change, or at least until financial resources become available. PAs require a paradigm shift, which includes tailoring of financial mechanisms to practical and policy purposes, effective allocation of financial resources, and responsible tourism recovery plans that capture the value and efforts of conservation through tourism and investments in nature-based solutions for sustainable tourism within PA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important tools for maintaining biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and conserving and restoring natural ecosystems. Management effectiveness assessment is an important component of conservation management in protected areas. In this study, we constructed a management effectiveness assessment tool based on publicly available information for China, with a total score of 126. We used the tool to systematically assess 27 national MPAs in the East China Sea. Our results showed that marine nature reserves (MNRs) and marine special reserves (MSRs) could be classified into two and three classifications, respectively, including MNRs I (n = 4, scores = 88-100), MNRs II (n = 6, scores = 75-81), MSRs I (n = 8, scores = 75-90), MSRs II (n = 6, scores = 59-75) and MSRs III (n = 3, scores = 53-56). Factors influencing the management effectiveness of nature reserves were the length of establishment and general public budget revenue, while for special reserves they were the length of establishment and total agricultural output value. Furthermore, protected areas with high management effectiveness scores tend to have a longer establishment time, dedicated management departments, adequate management staff and financial investment compared to those with low scores. In addition, the low-score MPAs require more communication with stakeholders. The study provides an objective and comprehensive systematic scoring of MPAs’ management using METT-based framework and multi-source data. It overcomes the challenge of the general lack of data on MPAs and provides a new approach to management effectiveness assessment. Copyright © 2023 Chen, Zeng, Zeng, Liu, Wang, Shi and Cao.},

abstract={Protected areas play a paramount role in counteracting the negative effects of human activity on the environment. Without good management effectiveness they might not be able to fulfill their mission. The tools for management effectiveness assessments that are currently most widely used struggle to provide sufficient depth of analysis, present the situation with sufficient breadth of indicators, provide necessary objectivity in identifying challenges during the assessment, and suggesting possible paths for improvement. The Integrated Management Effectiveness Tool (IMET), a novel tool for management effectiveness, is introduced in the article. The purpose of the article is to show that IMET offers instruments for a more in-depth analysis when compared to other protected areas management effectiveness assessment methodologies. Furthermore, the article demonstrates how the introduction of instruments that aid in decision-making and encourage a results-oriented approach can be particularly beneficial in enhancing managerial effectiveness. Additionally, it is asserted that IMET enhances planning and monitoring by incorporating the necessary components into a system of Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation. IMET has been tested in the field. Ten protected areas from Central Africa (CA) were selected and the tool demonstrated good properties in discriminating between well-performing protected areas and those with a room for improvement. The initial results have pointed to challenges in the management effectiveness dimensions of inputs and process that the studied protected areas are facing. In the long-run IMET is expected to support transition from merely routine management to results-oriented management of protected areas. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The establishment of protected areas (PA) is one of the most prominent biodiversity conservation policies in the Philippines. Functions of the country’s PA policy include the reduction of deforestation, forest conservation, and decreasing human pressure on natural resources. This study aimed to assess the drivers of forest intactness and fragmentation in selected terrestrial PAs. Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) scores were used to consider the impact of drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) change, including economic development, population, road networks, cultivation, and PA management, on the percentage of forest cover and different fragmentation metrics in the PAs. The study conducted a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Multiple Regression Analysis to identify the significant drivers of LULC change for each response variable. CCA and Multiple Regression Analysis results showed the most important predictors of LULC based on their canonical weights: cultivation within the PA, the human development index, and the regional gross domestic product. Aside from being the most important driving factor based on the CCA, cultivation inside the PA was also found to be a common significant variable for most dependent variables. Other significant factors were poverty index, population, and road density, which could all provide a basis for the observed PA fragmentation. The study also found that higher METT scores had a negative influence on the open forest and a positive effect on patch richness. This indicates that open forests tend to decrease as PA management improves while patch richness tends to increase. Furthermore, there is no data to support that METT scores have a significant influence on other response variables. © 2023, Philippine-American Academy of Science and Engineering.

abstract={The loss of marine biodiversity is a major global issue that needs to be prioritised. In Australia, a considerable proportion (48%) of its Exclusive Economic Zone is dedicated to marine protected areas. To effectively manage this network of marine protected areas Australia has recently introduced a Management Effectiveness system. This system is designed to identify, monitor, and manage natural values and the various activities and pressures affecting the Australian Marine Parks (AMPs). Key to this approach is the identification and accurate mapping of the location of these values and pressures acting on the seabed. The AusSeabed program is a national initiative in Australia aimed at improving access to bathymetric data and coordinating efforts to collect such data in Australian waters. This manuscript proposes a novel systematic processing method to create detailed and scalable geomorphometric maps from AusSeabed’s bathymetric data holdings, intended as a standard operating procedure for initial bathymetric data interpretation in the AMPs. Utilising this workflow, we produce seafloor geomorphometry maps across 37 AMPs within which sufficient bathymetric data has been collected. These maps can be used 1) for predictive mapping of biological assemblages; 2) in field sampling design for the collection of ‘ground truthing’ data (e.g. underwater imagery and sediment samples) to validate habitat maps from bathymetric datasets; and 3) as input datasets for subsequent geomorphological mapping with a deeper understanding of seafloor processes. This research highlights the importance of robust geomorphometry classification standards to ensure consistency in mapping Australia’s marine estate in preparation for the Decade of Oceans plans. The Seamap Australia program provides a stepwise approach to advancing Australia’s national collection of bathymetric data into derived products that can enable habitat mapping of Australian waters, providing a foundational tool for the adaptive management of AMPs.

abstract={The implementation of protected areas, in particular, nature Conservation Units (CUs), is a conservation strategy recognised worldwide. However, these territories require effi-cient management to achieve their conservation goals. When the management of CUs is deficient, it results in damage to their own goals, affecting biodiversity and ecological processes, as well as causing social and economic impacts. In this context, we evaluated the management effectiveness of 11 integral Conservation Units of nature in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, through interviews, visits to these CUs and a review of their official documents. For this analysis, we used the adapted method of Effectiveness of Management of Protected Areas (EMAP), which was analysed using a Likert scale with five levels, eight scopes, 73 indicators and 65 evaluation scenarios. Ninety-one percent of the CUs assessed in southern Brazil by the EMAP method oscillated from average to very unsatisfactory efficacy and low management effectiveness: 18% of the CUs had a very unsatisfactory quality of management, 37% unsatisfactory, 36% average and only 9% high or satisfactory. Moreover, the CUs did not fulfil the main objectives for which they were created. In this context, we recommended a series of actions to be applied for CU improvement, such as the adoption of a quali-quantitative evaluation model for the units, through a mathematical model; increase in staff; training teams and managers; improvement of CU infrastructure and inputs; regular budget allocation; land regularisation, implementation of consultative councils and urgent review of management plans. t: © P.

abstract={Local Ecological Knowledge and social perceptions of human communities that depend on natural resources can provide important baseline information on local threats and impacts at a fine scale for conservation management. Seahorses play important economic role in Brazilian mangroves, being sought-after for seahorse-watching tours. This touristic activity is not yet formally regulated and our work is a contribution to seahorse-watching management at three study sites located in two Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) – Jericoacoara National Park, and Delta do Parnaíba Environmental Protection Area – in the Brazilian northeast states of Ceará, Piauí, and Maranhão. Through semi-structured interviews, we investigated the perception of seahorse-watching operators regarding seahorse abundance, local threats, and conservation insights in mangrove ecosystems. We interviewed all 38 existing informants at the study sites. Approximately half of the informants rely exclusively on seahorse-watching as an income source. Overall, 55.3% highlighted declines in seahorse abundance, 100% believed that seahorses are threatened with extinction. Silting (57.9%), fishing (55.3%), and pollution (37%) were cited as main threats to seahorses and mangroves. Among the proposed conservation actions, environmental surveillance (57.9%), zoning (26.3%), education (26.3%) were the most cited. Respondents support the MPAs but would like to see greater engagement of management institutions towards the communities, considering their local needs. Some differences in perception between communities reflect local realities and social contexts, which should be considered for conservation and management effectiveness. Our study contributes supporting this approach, as local scale studies on social perceptions can improve conservation and local management, especially for data-poor species.

abstract={Since the adoption of the Habitats and Birds Directives by EU governments, marine Natura 2000 (N2K) sites have been established in the European Mediterranean Sea, creating one of the largest international networks of protected areas. Nevertheless, to date, marine N2K sites are generally scarcely implemented, studied and monitored, and thus their management effectiveness is weak, and their environmental status is often unknown. The Interreg Italy-Croatia ECOSS project aimed at establishing the ECOlogical observing system of the Adriatic Sea (ECOAdS), to integrate the existing research and monitoring activities in the area, and to promote data sharing at international level, for enhancing monitoring and conservation in Adriatic N2K network. In the framework of ECOSS, a conceptual model was developed and applied to selected N2K sites, to review the existing knowledge, assess site effectiveness, and suggest possible improvements in their monitoring and management based on the contribution that ECOAdS can provide to their implementation. Information on social, ecological, and oceanographic elements related to the conservation and management of these case studies was gathered by consulting the project partners involved in the management and monitoring of the sites and through a literature review. The results of this study revealed a discouraging condition with no management plan in most of the sites, while regulatory measures are generally in place but without surveillance. Monitoring activities are performed occasionally, and information on presence and status of protected species is often lacking or outdated. Although the N2K network provides a unique opportunity to advance marine conservation and achieve the 30% conservation target by 2030, the biggest challenge ahead is the proper management and monitoring of N2K sites. The proposed conceptual model may be taken as a framework to properly set up ecological observing systems in the N2K network and help overcome current limitations, integrating scientific research within the N2K conservation strategies.

abstract={Background: Land use-land cover change (LULCC) resulting from anthropogenic activities has been one of the major causes of loss of biodiversity globally. Thus, understanding the dynamics of such LULCC, especially within protected areas, is important to assess their past-present management effectiveness, identify the driving forces and assist future implementation of mitigation measures. The objectives of this study, based on satellite images analysis, were to examine and describe patterns of LULCC within and in the buffer zone area of Chebera Churchura National Park, SW Ethiopia, at five points in time (1985, 1991, 2000, 2010, and 2020); and to examine management effectiveness of the park authority in slowing down the rate of LULCCs after the establishment of the park. Results: Results showed that different land cover types exhibited varying patterns of change over the last 35 years. However, major differences were detected between the park area boundary and its buffer zone area after establishment of the park. From the year 1991 to 2000 (before the establishment), grassland declined by 52.9% (120.55km2) and 58.9% (151.9km2) within the park boundary and its buffer zone, respectively. After the establishment, grassland continued to decline only in the buffer zone. Similarly, agricultural land declined by 13.2% (2.7 km2) within the park but expanded by 5.4% (3.1 km2) in the buffer zone prior to park establishment. However, after establishment of the park, agricultural land in the buffer zone increased by 99.4% (99.7 km2). Grassland and wooded grassland had the opposite trend within the park area before vs after the establishment of the park. Conclusions: Results of the present study showed that striking differences in the rates of LULCCs within the park area and its buffer zone after establishment of the park, with the implication that the management is effective in slowing down LULCC relative to that in the buffer zone areas. In sum, this study would serve as a showcase on cost-effective means to assess human impacts on biodiversity in protected areas due to policy changes. Findings of the study would serve as a bench mark to evaluate future management effectives of the park authority. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Aichi Target 11 committed governments to protect ≥17% of their terrestrial environments by 2020, yet it was rarely achieved, raising questions about the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework goal to protect 30% by 2030. Asia is a challenging continent for such targets, combining high biodiversity with dense human populations. Here, we evaluated achievements in Asia against Aichi Target 11. We found that Asia was the most underperforming continent globally, with just 13.2% of terrestrial protected area (PA) coverage, averaging 14.1 ± SE 1.8% per country in 2020. 73.1% of terrestrial ecoregions had <17% representation and only 7% of PAs even had an assessment of management effectiveness. We found that a higher agricultural land in 2015 was associated with lower PA coverage today. Asian countries also showed a remarkably slow average annual pace of 0.4 ± SE 0.1% increase of PA extent. These combined lines of evidence suggest that the ambitious 2030 targets are unlikely to be achieved in Asia unless the PA coverage to increase 2.4-5.9 times faster. We provided three recommendations to support Asian countries to meet their post-2020 biodiversity targets: complete reporting and the wider adoption “other effective area-based conservation measures”; restoring disturbed landscapes; and bolstering transboundary PAs. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The continuous decline of global biodiversity highlights the need for the expansion and improved performance of protected areas (PAs) to achieve the Post-2020 Biodiversity Targets and 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. China proposed the establishment of a national park (NP) system and carried out transformative explorations in 10 pilot NPs, however, it is unclear to what extent the pilot NPs represent China's biodiversity and resolve management issues. To answer this question, we assessed the performance of the pilot NPs by analyzing the representativeness across typical ecosystems, biodiversity priority areas, and ecosystem services, and by analyzing the management effectiveness of reorganizing the existing PAs and improving the management intensity and man-land relationships. We found that China's pilot NPs achieved improved representativeness and management effectiveness through range expansion and optimization, institution streamlining, and cohesive management. Compared with the existing PAs, the area of protected typical ecosystems, biodiversity priority areas, and key areas of ecosystem services in the 10 pilot NPs increased by 59.6%, 59.6%, and 54.1% on average, respectively, with a similar land cost overall. The 10 pilot NPs integrated 142 existing PAs of seven categories. The protected areas expanded by 19.4%, and the area under strict protection increased by 42.1%. Additionally, the pilot NPs effectively reduced human disturbance and improved management effectiveness through necessary relocation and enhanced land management. Moving forward, the boundaries and zoning of the NPs should be further optimized, and efforts should be directed to strengthen the governing capacity building, improve the legislation system, increase the financing investment, and promote the value realization of ecological products. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The 2020 global spatial targets for protected areas set by the Convention on Biological Diversity have almost been achieved, but management effectiveness remains deficient. Personnel shortages are widely cited as major contributing factors but have not previously been quantified. Using data from 176 countries and territories, we estimate a current maximum of 555,000 terrestrial protected area personnel worldwide (one per 37 km2), including 286,000 rangers (one per 72 km2), far short of published guidance on required densities. Expansion by 2030 to 30% coverage of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures is widely agreed as a minimum for safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. We project that effective management of this expanded system will require approximately 3 million personnel (one per 13 km2), including more than 1.5 million rangers or equivalents (one per 26 km2). Parallel improvements in resourcing, working conditions and capacity are required for effective, equitable and sustainable management. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Indonesia's marine ecosystems are among the most diverse in the world, supporting extensive critical habitats with strong connections to coastal communities. To keep pace with increasing pressures on the environment, conservation efforts need to be strengthened and expanded. The Government of Indonesia has committed to protecting marine ecosystems through establishing 32.5 million ha of marine protected areas (MPAs), with 20 million ha effectively managed, by 2030. Therefore, collating data on the status and progress of marine conservation efforts nationally is important to show the extent to which this target is being reached. Here we provide an overview of the status and trends of spatial coverage and management effectiveness of MPAs in Indonesia. As of 2020, Indonesia had made good progress in reaching its target – with 23.9 million ha MPA established and some —albeit slow— increases in MPA management effectiveness. Moving forward, we recommend that marine protection efforts in Indonesia need to balance MPAs expansion with improvement in effectiveness. Improvement of management effectiveness will require significant efforts, including improving institutional coordination, ensuring adequate human and financial resources, and strengthened monitoring, evaluation, and learning to inform adaptive management. Future MPA expansion should focus on addressing specific gaps in the existing network, such as increasing coastal habitat representation, and connectivity, or increasing recognition of a diversity of governance approaches (e.g., by communities or private entities). Progress over recent decades, however, suggests Indonesia is making progress on its marine protection goals and is well placed to meet potential future targets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={World cultural landscape heritage (WCLH), recognized as a combination of cultural relics and natural landscapes with outstanding significance and universal value, is unique in terms of its differentiation from the deliberate human creativity of general cultural heritage and the “deartificialization” of natural heritage. To date, the management of WCLH has become increasingly standardized. However, with the prevalence of heritage resource development activities such as heritage tourism, the phenomenon of “urbanization”, “commercialization”, “artificialization” and other issues have gradually emerged in WCLH sites. Thus, the management issues of WCLH have become increasingly serious, leading to intense concerns about the unsustainable development of WCLH. Drawing inspirations from management effectiveness (ME) evaluation research of protected areas and acknowledging the uniqueness of WCLH, this study constructs a WCLH ME evaluation system consisting of four general criteria (management foundation, management system, management measures and management performance), 16 factors and 34 indicators. The evaluation system is applied and verified through an empirical study of five existing WCLH sites in China. The empirical results show that the ME of Chinese WCLH is at a “good” level. Specifically, the management of Chinese WCLH is overall impressive in indicators of management planning, heritage protection performance and economic performance but shows deficiency in indicators of protection fees, management infrastructure, management assessment, management institution, social performance, etc. Finally, this study discusses the management issues of respective heritage sites to provide suggestions and inspirations for the development, protection and management of the sites and other cultural landscapes in China and even the world. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The aim of this study is to assess marine-protected areas’ (MPAs) effectiveness in the protection of marine mammals. With this purpose, the study analyzed the long-term population trend of four different species of marine mammals, geographically placed in distant MPAs. In addition, matching biophysical and governance indicators were identified in order to relate the different management approaches to the biological effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the respective MPA. The results show population recovery trends, providing empirical evidence that suggests the effectiveness of area-based protection measures in marine mammals. Moreover, a parallelism between the governance indicators and the biophysical ones supports that biological and management effectiveness are interrelated. On this basis, the biophysical indicator of human impact was discussed to be deeply related to the precautionary principle, which appears less efficient than the adaptive management. Finally, this study highlights the necessity to better monitor the effectiveness of MPAs in order to avoid paper parks and suggest future recommendations.

abstract={The establishment and management of protected areas are critical strategies for biodiversity conservation and preventing tropical forest loss. We analysed 2020 management effectiveness data from Brazil’s SAMGe evaluation platform in 133 areas of the Brazilian Amazon under varying deforestation pressures. We did not find any significant correlation between overall management effectiveness and deforestation, whereas distance to roads was negatively correlated. There is a higher occurrence of prohibited uses and fewer encouraged uses within highly deforested protected areas. Moreover, most of these areas also presented higher equipment expenditure scores, suggesting that resources are allocated towards protection actions. Most deforestation is likely driven by opportunity, as highly perturbed locations are generally much less isolated than those with very low deforestation scores. To avoid forest loss, complementary strategies that reduce the external forces leading to deforestation must urgently be implemented. © 2022, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={As freshwater environments become increasingly threatened, the need for efficient and effective protection grows more urgent. Yet quantitative evidence of management effectiveness within freshwater protected areas is limited, inhibiting our ability to infer the practicality and efficacy of practices. Herein, we employ linear mixed-effects models and time series models to evaluate the connection between catchment-scale management actions and surface water quality within a freshwater protected area, over the past three decades. Within the study area, all croplands were restored to traditional grasslands resulting in a landscape dominated by meadows and forests. The extent of land use change and time frame needed for water quality improvements were investigated and management effectiveness appraised. Results indicate that the complete grassing of croplands was approximately three times more effective at reducing concentrations of nitrate than electrical conductivity and calcium. Significant improvements in water quality occurred within nine years of management implementation, with mean annual nitrate concentrations decreasing from 5.5 to 1.9 mg/L following the grassing of all croplands covering 3.1% of the study area, whereas gradual improvements continued over the next 20 years, ultimately resulting in nitrate concentrations below 1.0 mg/L. The results of this study provide valuable insights on how land use conversions in small headwater catchments can influence stream water quality and helps to establish expectations for outcomes when planning conservation strategies. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been one of the main strategies for the conservation of marine ecosystems and an attempt to buffer or revert anthropogenic and natural disturbances. However, only the implementation of an MPA does not guarantee effectiveness in the maintenance of these environments. The involvement of the stakeholders in the whole process is crucial for the MPAs to achieve their conservation goals. With this, we provide here an understanding of the dynamics on how different stakeholders engage in marine reserves management, to inform courses of action and improve conservation and governance at multiple scales. Through semi-structured questionnaires, we investigated which anthropogenic threats were mostly perceived by stakeholders in three Brazilian marine reserves. We compare the perceptions of the members of the management councils and the staff of each reserve, in addition to verifying whether there were differences among their perceptions and to identify correlations between perceptions on management effectiveness and environmental quality. Illegal fishing and exotic species were the most important threats identified. No differences were verified between the perceptions of managers and members of the management board of the marine reserve and there was also no relationship between the perception of effectiveness and quality of environmental attributes. The different stakeholders’ interests and their socioeconomic and cultural background is discussed as influencing the perceptions of management effectiveness. However, the similarity in threat perceptions reported in this study may be explained by the lower level of complexity and subjectivity in opinions in comparison with management effectiveness evaluations. Our results provide an overview of perceptions on threats and on the environmental quality of subtropical marine reserves in the Southwestern Atlantic, which can be used to guide funding and policy priorities that mitigate the effects of anthropogenic threats on marine reserves and thus contribute to creating a win–win scenario. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Scholars and practitioners have been striving to develop straightforward and effective tools to measure protected area management effectiveness (PAME). UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR), with their unique functional and zonation schemes are monitored according to their compulsory 10-year Periodic Review (PR), which is useful for UNESCO’s evaluation purposes but lacks comprehensiveness and utility for adaptive management. Based on existing PAME methodologies, we develop and propose the first quantitative tool for the evaluation of BR management effectiveness, that would enhance and complement the currently used qualitative PR report, and serve the rapid evaluation needed for BR managers to monitor, evaluate, and adapt their management approach to achieve the three functions of BRs. The tool consists of 65 indicators, embodied within the 6 elements of the World Commission on Protected Areas Framework. We then tested this tool, named Biosphere Reserve Effectiveness of Management index (BREMi) to evaluate management effectiveness across the Arab Man and the Biosphere Reserve network involving 17 BRs spanning 8 countries of the Middle East and North Africa. BREMi scores ranged from 4.43 to 8.65 (on a scale between 0 and 10), with a mean of 6.31 ± 1.040. All indicators were considered valuable measures of progress by our respondents, as well as by independent experts. We discuss our findings in light of available literature concerning the Arab region and through the conceptual frames of adaptive management and resilience. Finally, we discuss where the BREMi tool would be most useful for BR management authorities in the iterative process of evaluation and adaptive management. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) are a key strategy for conserving areas of outstanding biodiversity value and promoting sustainable development. Significant efforts have been made toward establishing PAs over the last few decades across the globe. However, an assessment of PAs in mountain regions, including in the biodiversity rich Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), is lacking. We assessed the status, trend, and distribution of PAs and the ecological representativeness in the PA network. Our analysis showed the HKH has a total of 575 PAs covering 40.17% of the region, accounting for 8.49% of global PA coverage. The HKH hosts 335 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), 348 Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), 12 Global 200 Ecoregions, and 4 Global Biodiversity Hotspots. However, the study showed limited ecological representation in the current PA system as 67% of ecoregions, 39% of hotspots, 69% of KBAs, and 76% of IBAs are still outside of the PA system. About 47% of the PAs are small (<250 sq. km) with no connectivity to other PAs and the majority are distributed in the lower reaches of the HKH. These findings suggest the need to assess and demarcate potential corridors to improve connectivity between PAs and integrate PAs into wider conservation landscapes at national and regional scale beyond country boundaries through regional cooperation. There is also a need to assess and strengthen PA management effectiveness and governance and consider other effective area-based conservation measures especially in the higher elevations and with a specific focus on ecological representation. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={The dispersal of larvae by ocean currents is likely to represent an increasingly important driver of marine population dynamics across fragmented habitats. A boost in availability of larval dispersal data from biophysical simulations has therefore led to routine calculations of population connectivity metrics that are used for area-based management decision support, including the placement of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). However, connectivity-based decision support for area-based management is often complex, highly uncertain, and the associated conservation impact rarely if ever evaluated. In combination, these challenges risk stakeholder engagement, compliance, and overall management effectiveness. Here we use a case study representing multiple key fishery species on coral reefs in Indonesia to demonstrate that consideration of larval dispersal for MPA placement decision support could be critical to recover both fish populations and fisheries from depletion, thereby mitigating potentially severe impacts on coastal communities. Importantly, we further show that MPA placement decisions can be effective even if based on comparatively simple and empirically measurable dispersal characteristics. Maximizing larval export, expressed as the contribution of larvae from MPA candidate sites to total larval settlement in surrounding areas, for example, was found to be a broadly beneficial MPA placement prioritization approach. Across investigated fish families with diverse life histories, this strategy resulted in MPA network designs that increased catches by a factor of 1.3 ± 0.3 (mean ± SD) and total fish biomass by a factor of 3.2 ± 0.3 (9.7 ± 1.2 in no-fishing areas and 1.4 ± 0.3 in fished areas) compared to conditions without effectively managed or protected areas. Our findings are relevant for both the implementation and impact evaluation of global marine conservation policies, specifically in tropical biodiversity hotspots, such as Indonesia, where coral reefs are often overfished and increasingly threatened but local communities highly dependent on sustainable fisheries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Climate change is challenging the ability of protected areas (PAs) to meet their objectives. To improve PA planning, we developed a framework for assessing PA vulnerability to climate change based on consideration of potential climate change impacts on species and their habitats and resource use. Furthermore, the capacity of PAs to adapt to these climate threats was determined through assessment of PA management effectiveness, adjacent land use, and financial resilience. Users reach a PA-specific vulnerability score and rank based on scoring of these categories. We applied the framework to South Africa's 19 national parks. Because the 19 parks are managed as a national network, we explored how resources might be best allocated to address climate change. Each park's importance to the network's biodiversity conservation and revenue generation was estimated and used to weight overall vulnerability scores and ranks. Park vulnerability profiles showed distinct combinations of potential impacts of climate change and adaptive capacities; the former had a greater influence on vulnerability. Mapungubwe National Park emerged as the most vulnerable to climate change, despite its relatively high adaptive capacity, largely owing to large projected changes in species and resource use. Table Mountain National Park scored the lowest in overall vulnerability. Climate change vulnerability rankings differed markedly once importance weightings were applied; Kruger National Park was the most vulnerable under both importance scenarios. Climate change vulnerability assessment is fundamental to effective adaptation planning. Our PA assessment tool is the only tool that quantifies PA vulnerability to climate change in a comparative index. It may be used in data-rich and data-poor contexts to prioritize resource allocation across PA networks and can be applied from local to global scales. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={As threats to biodiversity proliferate, establishment and expansion of protected areas have increasingly been advocated in recent decades. In establishing a network of protected areas, recurrent assessments of the biodiversity conservation actually afforded by these areas is required. Gap analysis has been useful to evaluate the sufficiency and performance of protected areas. We surveyed Reeves's Pheasant Syrmaticus reevesii populations in 2018-2019 across its distribution range in central China to quantify the distribution of habitat suitable for this species. Our goal was to ascertain the current distribution of Reeves's Pheasant and then identify the gaps in protecting Reeves's Pheasant of the existing national nature reserve (NNR) network to provide suggestions for improving the conservation of this important species. The existing NNR network encompassed only 17.0% of the habitat suitable for Reeves's Pheasant. Based on the current distributions of both suitable habitat and NNRs for Reeves's Pheasant, we suggest most currently unprotected areas comprised moderately suitable habitat for species and should be prioritized in the future. A multiple species approach using Reeves's Pheasant as a flagship species should be considered to understand the extent of mismatch between the distributions of protected areas and suitable habitat to improve the management effectiveness of NNRs. This case study provides an example of how the development of a conservation reserve network may be based on species distribution and habitat assessments and is useful to conservation efforts in other regions and for other species. ©},

abstract={The conservation flagship approach is a valuable tool for raising funds and awareness, but species-based campaigns have been criticized for providing little benefit to wider biodiversity. One possible solution is to use conservation areas as flagships, but we lack data on the types of area that most appeal to potential donors. Here, we used an online choice experiment involving hypothetical overseas conservation areas to investigate how respondents value a series of conservation area attributes. We calculated the average willingness to pay for each attribute and assessed preference heterogeneity. Our results suggest that community ownership is valued the most, followed by the presence of threatened bird species, low current funding in the conservation area, the presence of charismatic mammals, and charity ownership. Respondents could be divided into three groups, based on their education, environmental organization membership and income. The group of respondents who were less wealthy and were members of environmental organizations were not willing to pay for this kind of conservation action, suggesting that flagship area campaigns targeted at them should encourage other types of involvement. The other two groups, which included respondents who were less engaged in conservation (neither group included environmental organization members, with one group less wealthy and less educated, and the other wealthier), found community ownership particularly appealing, suggesting that many potential donors may be driven by social concerns. This is a key finding and suggests flagship conservation areas could attract a new audience of donors, helping to support current global efforts to increase the management effectiveness, connectivity and extent of protected areas and land under other effective area-based conservation measures.

abstract={The management effectiveness of protected areas plays a key role in biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation. We evaluated the effectiveness of Qilian Mountain Nature Reserve (QMNR) in reducing human footprint (HF). Four dominant human activity factors, including population density, land use, road distribution, and night light, were incorporated for HF mapping. Comparisons of the HF value between inside and outside QMNR and its four functional zones were conducted. The results show that both the HF inside and outside of QMNR were increasing, but the difference between them was increasing, indicating partial management effectiveness. The north part of the central reserve has a good effect in reducing human impacts, while the effectiveness was poor at both ends of the reserve. The HF value of the most strictly managed core and buffer zones increased by 10.50 and 6.68%, respectively, for 2010–2020. The QMNR was effective in controlling population density and land use, but ineffective in reducing road construction, mining, and construction of hydropower facilities. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={In many tropical areas of high conservation concern there is still no evidence on the effectiveness of protected areas in protecting specific components of biodiversity. Here, to assess the management effectiveness of protected areas, we carried out a field sampling design for collecting data on waterbird communities within the Nibule National Park (South Sudan), a poorly-known hot-spot of biodiversity, and in the surrounding buffer zone. All the metrics of richness (absolute species richness, Margalef index, Chao-1) and diversity were significantly higher for bird communities inhabiting the national park, when compared to the buffer zone. Evenness was predictably lower in the national park when compared to the buffer zone, probably due to the large numbers of rare species that were observed in the park’s richer communities, thus increasing the differences in relative frequencies between species. The diversity profiles highlighted this pattern, with more sloping curves in the park sites, evidencing a role of protected area management in positively affecting the bird community structure. Our data provide the first evidence for a poorly-known area of high conservation concern on the effective role played by a National Park in maintaining high values of richness and diversity, at least for wetland-related birds. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={In the Mexican Caribbean, marine protected areas have been established to tackle marine ecosystem degradation caused by the coastal development that started in Cancún in the 1970s and extended south to the border with Belize in the 1990s. It is crucial to assess their effectiveness for conservation of the reef ecosystem, but also the perception of stakeholders, because the objective would be unattainable without their participation. This study evaluated the conservation status and the management effectiveness of National Park Xcalak Reefs (PNAX), in the southernmost Mexican Caribbean. In addition to interviewing local stakeholders to recognize issues related to the administration and functioning of PNAX, four zones with different use restrictions inside the park were evaluated, using ecological indicators (diversity and abundance of fishes, coral diversity and cover, and macroalgal cover) and ecological knowledge by interviewing local stakeholders, mostly fishers and conservation personnel. The results suggest that one of the restricted-use zones is in good condition, with a higher abundance of fishes and coral cover, and a lower cover of fleshy macroalgae and turf, compared with the other zones in the protected area. On the other hand, the core area presents bad indicators, such as a higher macroalgal cover and lower abundance of fishes, suggesting poor management or insufficient enforcement. Although mistrust and lack of communication between fishers and conservation authorities may limit the achievement of conservation goals, some programmes involving active participation of local people, for example lionfish culling and coastal vegetation restoration, have had a good impact on the coral reef community. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid development of China’s economy has brought tremendous pressure to the marine ecosystem, and about 57% of marine fish populations have been overexploited or collapsed. A series of fisheries policies have been implemented successively to improve the decline of resources. Over the past decade, the fisheries sector has particularly increased focus on resource and ecosystem sustainability, which has led to the wider use of stock management policies in China. Therefore, fishery resource assessment is crucial, such as assessing the long-term changes in biological information. This study is based on biological characteristics of Johnius belengerii captured by bottom trawls in Xiamen Bay during two periods, beginning in 2006 and 2016. Length composition, length–weight relationship, growth, mortality, sexual maturation, and feeding intensity were analyzed. The changes in biological characteristics show that there is a phenomenon of improvement in the later period, of which the changes are closely related to a series of fisheries management strategies, such as setting closed fishing periods and non-fishing areas, and establishing fishery restoration marine protected areas. This result seems to reveal the effectiveness of a long-term series of fisheries policies. It can provide an important basis and visibility for management effectiveness. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Background and Research Aims: Buffer zone programs aim to reduce park-people conflicts by improving local livelihoods through integrated conservation and development activities. A case study was conducted at Sagarmatha National Park, Nepal from 2002–2016 to examine some buffer zone initiatives. Methods: Focus group discussions (n = 7), key informant interviews (n = 14), and field observations were performed in accordance with the IUCN Framework for Assessing Management Effectiveness of Protected Areas 2006 and WWF´s Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management 2006. Results: A total of 99 buffer zone activities were identified, including a variety of construction activities such as hydroelectric projects, trails, schools, and monasteries. Park funds were allocated mainly for community development and social welfare (42%), and less on conservation and conflict management (22%). For example, traditional “Nawa” animal rearing practices, feral dog control, and mitigation of wildlife damages to crops and livestock were overlooked. Conclusion: Support gained from the buffer zone program to address livelihoods of needy households who suffer from wildlife damages was lacking, despite legal provisions for compensation (e.g. crop damages caused by jharal). This should not occur at the expense of wildlife conservation and if it does, it will diminish the original intent of buffer zones. Implications for Conservation: Although most of the local communities were positive about buffer zone programs and activities, there was a dire need to incorporate “Nawa” practices, wildlife damage compensation schemes, and feral dog controls. This study suggests to update policies that focus on conflict management. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Protected areas are critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. In the last few years, there has been growing recognition of the role of indigenous peoples and local communities in the management of government designated protected areas, and thus their perceptions and adaptability were paid much attention. Drawing on a survey of 487 residents in the Qilian Mountain National Park Pilot of Northwestern China, this study used the adaptive analysis framework to study the adaptability of local residents. The main contribution of this paper is to select a typical social-ecological system to study the adaptability of local residents, and using Elinor Ostrom’s Social-Ecological System framework to analyze the adaptability mechanism. The results show that different types of residents had different adaptability to environmental change. People whose income mainly depends on work salary with a small part of herding have the highest level of adaptability, while people whose income mostly comes from farming with a small part of herding have the lowest level. This result is related to people’s living location, as people living in the core zone and buffer zone of the reserve mainly earned from grazing, and people living in the experimental zone and peripheral zone earned mainly from outside work. Moreover, people living in the core zone and buffer zone are mostly elders and ethnic groups, while people in the experimental zone and buffer zone are Han people. To improve management effectiveness and to avoid conflict between local residents and managers, this paper suggests that more attention should be paid to these who have lived for a long time in the core zone and buffer zone. They are the most vulnerable groups and show low adaptability in almost all domains. For the long run, education quality should be improved to decrease the population in the reserve. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Marine protected area (MPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) have been crucial in protecting endangered species and habitats for sustainable ecosystem and marine biodiversity. China has nearly six decades of experience in the practice of MPAs. However, the management effectiveness of China's MPAs has been impeded by issues accumulated over the years. In 2018, the Chinese government embarked on a major institutional reform (2018 Reform) to upgrade its MPAs into natural protected area (NPA) system. This strategic decision and subsequent actions in transforming the existing protected areas (marine and terrestrial) to NPAs have brought substantial changes with significant implications towards an ecosystem-based management approach of China's national system for marine conservation. Based on the investigation of 27 representative MPAs and OECMs across the country, this study used 12 performance indicators to evaluate the management effectiveness of China's MPA system, and identified key issues affecting the effective operation of the system. The results indicated that the major issues hampering management effectiveness include multiple management agencies, lack of systematic planning for classification and zoning, lack of unified and specific legal system, and insufficient financial supports. On this basis, we examined new policy directives and work in progress relating to the reform, highlighted major changes to illustrate the extent to which the key issues being addressed, and pointed out the implications of the 2018 reform towards an ecosystem-based management approach and China's national effort towards global goals of conserving marine biodiversity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

See National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Various domestic protected areas have reached the number of 11, 800 (in Chinese); Bohorquez, J.J., Xue, G., Frankstone, T., Grima, M.M., Kleinhaus, K., Zhao, Y., (2014), E.K. Pikitch. In addition, 53 national marine aquatic germplasm reserves (AGRs, fisheries conservation zones) have been established to protect genetic and economic value of aquatic species, together with habitats and migration routes. About 4.5% of China's marine and coastal habitats were protected by MPAs. A total of 12.98% marine and coastal habitats were protected by these MPAs and AGRs. For detailed discussions, see, China's little-known efforts to protect its marine ecosystems safeguard some habitats but omit others, Sci. Adv. 1569 (2021). doi:10.1126/sciadv.abj1569. G. Shen, M.

MPAs are important because China's marine fisheries have been the largest in the world since 1990s, and put intense pressure on China's marine resources and have led to a significant increase in domestic fish stock collapses and widespread overfishing in recent decades.

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered the go-to tool for marine area-based conservation, having rapidly expanded in many countries, yet an understanding of progress and achievement in implementation remains vastly unexplored. Here, we assess the status and trends of coverage and protection, ecological conditions, marine resource use, human well-being, and management effectiveness of MPAs in the Sunda Banda Seascape (SBS), Indonesia, and provide the first comprehensive overview of marine conservation in the region. The SBS, located in the world's epicenter for marine biodiversity, has 85 designated MPAs (8.1 million ha) as of 2018, accounting for 35% of the national target of 23.4 million ha MPAs by 2020. Most SBS MPAs were recently initiated or established, and their management was strongly influenced by policy and governance changes at the national and provincial levels. SBS MPAs protect more than 30% of mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef habitats in the seascape, and surveys indicate relatively healthy coral reef conditions. Fishing is one of the most common livelihoods in the MPA communities; 90% of fishers use traditional gear types for fishing and destructive fishing is identified as the greatest threat to marine resources in the MPAs. Our findings suggest that balancing the expansion of MPAs with strengthening their management effectiveness and integrating diverse social-ecological local contexts are important aspects to achieve effective, equitable marine conservation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study applied the Korean framework of wetland management effectiveness evaluation to national wetland protected areas and identified key insights into developing a national wetland management policy. The framework is based on the basic evaluation framework of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and reflects the characteristics of South Korea’s wetland management policy. The evaluation framework comprises a total of 29 items and 21 detailed items in the design, appropriateness, and delivery sectors. Based on a cluster analysis, which considered the management levels of 22 sites that conducted first-stage self-assessment, the sites were divided into Groups A, B, and C. The second and third stages of qualitative evaluation were conducted on the representative target sites of each group by external research teams. The average score for the overall management level was the highest for Group B, followed by Groups C and A. Significant differences were observed among the groups for five items in the design sector, seven items in the appropriateness sector, and two items in the delivery sector. The management levels in the pilot sites were 43.9% in Yongneup of Mt. Daeam, 37.4% in the Damyang riverine wetland, and 59.8% in the Upo wetland, compared to the ideal condition. Important suggestions were derived through the evaluation framework. First, management effectiveness evaluation should consider national environmental and management policy characteristics based on an international framework. Second, an integrated management system should be established. Third, stakeholders should participate in building governance. Lastly, the participation of an external expert is essential. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract={The Western Hemisphere Warm Pool is the second warmest body of water on Earth and has been highlighted according to its significant influence on ocean and atmosphere components. This study focuses on the comparison of the interannual spatial variability of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool in the Eastern Pacific (WHWP-EP) according to satellite-derived data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. Secondly, the response of chlorophyll a (Chla) as a proxy of phytoplankton was evaluated for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs, which are considered the main tool for conservation of biological diversity) located in the Mexican Pacific with emphasis on anomalous events of the WHWP-EP. The response was predominantly negative, particularly in MPAs located in the Deep Mexican Pacific and southern Gulf of California, while the Midriff islands area (central Gulf of California) was not statistically significant due to the known higher resilience to warm events. Observed trends in the extension of the WHWP-EP and negative response of Chl-a in most of the MPAs highlight the need to consider phytoplankton in marine planning and management strategies, particularly in the area known as Deep Mexican Pacific, where MPAs has been reported with a lack of management effectiveness. ©},

abstract={The study was designed to understand how the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) scores in a Protected Area (PA) were influenced by conservation activities. Data was collected from documents on major conservation activities of the PA. Conservation outputs indicators of annual numbers of patrols organized, mammal and Roan Antelope observed, illegal activities recorded, offenders arrested, and livelihood beneficiaries were related to the METT scores in Spearman correlation tests. There were no statistically significant relationships between each of the METT elements and number of patrols, mammals and Roan Antelope observations. However, illegal activities, offenders arrested, and livelihood beneficiaries strongly correlated positively with all the elements. Again, Pearson correlation tests among patrols, illegal activities and mammals observed were not statistically significant. The findings indicate the PA socio-economic benefits to communities was positive. However, management must eliminate illegal logging that suggestively caused decline in mammal observations (X=2895.6, Std.=867.7, Range=2507). © 2022 by the author(s).},

The project was funded from the Global Environmental Facility sponsored by the World Bank. It was therefore obligatory for the PA to be assessed under the METT as it is a demand for all GEF funded projects (Hockings et al., 2018).

abstract={For more than 20 years Antarctic Treaty Parties have been discussing how to appropriately manage cumulative impacts in the continent. Preventing cumulative impacts requires the fluent exchange of information to enable proper and timely assessment of, and response to, the impacts that result from multiple activities, undertaken by multiple stakeholders and supervised by different Parties. This is a particular challenge for the effective management of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs), as a lack of coordination may potentially put at risk the fulfillment of their conservation objectives. Here we suggest that incorporating lessons learnt from protected areas management elsewhere might improve the effectiveness of ASPAs and provide valuable experiences and insights on how to better manage cumulative impacts in the rest of the continent. Key concepts to incorporate in Antarctica’s environmental management toolbox include (1) the notion of adaptive management, which is a cornerstone of protected areas management effectiveness elsewhere, and (2) the need of empowering protected area managers, which are a key (but often missing) element to ensure local compliance with management plans, co-ordinate on site activities, facilitate exchange of information, promote cooperation and manage conflicts. © 2022 Alvaro Soutullo et al.},

abstract={Area-Based Management Tools (ABMTs) are spatial instruments for conservation and managing different forms of ocean use. A multitude of ABMTs exists in marine areas within and beyond national jurisdiction, ranging from tools for the regulation of specific human activities (e.g. fisheries, shipping, or mining) to cross-sectoral tools (e.g. such as marine protected areas, MPAs, and marine spatial planning, MSP). By applying expert elicitation and reviewing scientific and grey literature we evaluate the contribution of ABMTs to sustainable development goals (SDGs) as set out under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including for SDG 14 that directly addresses the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources. We find that fisheries-related and conservation-related ABMTs, and MSP offer the greatest potential contributions to SDG 14 and to SDGs in general. Moreover, there is high complementarity and synergy among different ABMTs for most SDG 14 targets and other SDGs, with the exception of SDG target 14.6 Prohibit fisheries subsidies and SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy. We find that some ABMTs contribute directly to goal attainment, while others contribute in more nuanced or even unexpected ways. Furthermore, context-specific factors that relate to political and legal factors, enforceability, transparency, governance structure, and inclusivity are crucial for unlocking the full potential of ABMTs of attaining multiple SDGs, as shown through examples. The major challenge to face in the next decade is ensuring durable and equitable outcomes from ABMT implementation by coordinating ABMT initiatives established by different organisations and responsible authorities. It is also critical that outcomes are monitored and evaluated across environmental, social, economic, governance, and health dimensions, with indicators addressing management effectiveness and not only ABMT area coverage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the rapid global increase in the number and extent of marine protected areas (MPAs), there is a need for methods that enable an assessment of their actual contribution to biodiversity conservation. In Brazil, where MPAs have been designated to replenish biodiversity, there is a lack of regional-scale analysis of MPA impacts and the factors related to positive ecological change. This study aims to quantify the magnitude of the ecological effects of Brazilian MPAs and test whether some study and MPA characteristics (e.g., taxonomic group studied, exploitation level of species, MPA area, protection time, management effectiveness, level of connectedness, etc.) were underlying factors associated with their performance. We conducted a structured search in a database of scientific articles, selecting comparative studies of direct biodiversity metrics inside and outside MPAs offering different protection levels (i.e., fully- or partially-protected MPAs) or within MPAs with distinct zones. We then carried out a meta-analysis based on 424 observations found in 18 articles. Averaged across all studies, we found that MPAs had a 17% increase in the abundance of species, length of individuals, and community diversity. When compared to open-access areas, fully-protected MPAs increased biodiversity by 45%. However, MPAs offering partial protection had variable effects, ranging from significant positive to significant negative effects. MPA effects depended on the taxonomic group and exploitation level of species, with the strongest positive effects seen on exploited fish species and benthic invertebrates. Partially-protected MPAs that reported strong positive effects required long time of protection (>15years) and high level of connectivity. Conversely, fully-protected MPAs (i.e., no-take ones) could be effective even when small, under intense fishing pressure in their surroundings, and regardless of their level of connectivity. We used the Brazilian MPAs as a case study, but these results can contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the association between ecological impacts of MPAs and drivers of conservation success, and offer key information to consolidate MPA networks that sustain biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Protected areas aim to conserve nature, ecosystem services, and cultural values; however, they have variable success in doing so under high development pressure. Southeast Asian protected areas faced the highest level of human pressure at the turn of the twenty-first century. To estimate their effectiveness in conserving forest cover and forest carbon stocks for 2000–2018, we used statistical matching methods to control for the non-random location of protected areas, to compare protection against a matched counterfactual. We found Southeast Asian protected areas had three times less forest cover loss than similar landscapes without protection. Protected areas that had completed management reporting using the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) conserved significantly more forest cover and forest carbon stocks than those that had not. Management scores were positively associated with the level of carbon emissions avoided, but not the level of forest cover loss avoided. Our study is the first to find that METT scores could predict the level of carbon emissions avoided in protected areas. Given that only 11% of protected areas in Southeast Asia had completed METT surveys, our results illustrate the need to scale-up protected area management effectiveness reporting programs to improve their effectiveness for conserving forests, and for storing and sequestering carbon. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat was developed in 1971, and has established the world’s largest network of protected areas. However, monitoring and reporting have been inadequate to fully achieve the goals of the Convention. We argue that current reporting mechanisms, including the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM), and the R-METT reporting framework adopted at the 12th Conference of the Parties, are not well adapted to wetland systems and the objectives of the Ramsar Convention. This paper outlines one possible structure for a new reporting mechanism, explicitly focused on the Convention’s objectives of maintaining ecological character and promoting wise use within the context of sustainable development. Through these lenses, we developed a 15-question framework that would have site managers compile the most pertinent information relating to these two points quickly, including providing operational definitions, identifying allowable uses, quantifying economic benefits, reporting fundamental monitoring data, and assessing stakeholder engagement opportunities. We argue that, if we are to provide an informed outlook for the next half-century of wetland conservation under the Ramsar Convention, we must begin by refining its information-gathering protocols for its system of wetlands of international importance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Increases in area-based conservation are essential to halt biodiversity loss and respond to climate change. Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity are poised to adopt a target of protecting at least 30 per cent of the Earth’s lands, seas and freshwater by 2030. This is in the draft Global Biodiversity Framework and supported by over 70 countries who have joined the High Ambition Coalition. The IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas, in partnership with UNEP – World Conservation Monitoring Centre, National Geographic, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Birdlife International has published guidance entitled ‘Conserving at least 30% of the planet by 2030: What should count?’. This guidance calls for a focus on quality as an essential part of large area-based conservation targets. Quality includes many elements, including a focus on establishing protected and conserved areas in areas important for biodiversity, how they are designed and ecologically connected, and ensuring management effectiveness and governance equity. But protected and conserved areas must be realised in full partnership with Indigenous and local communities. The 30 per cent minimum target provides a significant opportunity to strengthen security of tenure, land and use rights especially for Indigenous Peoples and support to IPLC-led conservation efforts. Moving to protect at least 30 per cent of the Earth by 2030 is a grand challenge in which we need to speak a common language. © 2021, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={Merely designating new and/or expanding existing protected areas (PAs) does not guarantee the protection of critical ecosystems and species. The management of PAs must be effective to sustain meaningful conservational outcomes. We inferred the management effectiveness of PAs in Kenya based on the representation of ranges and distribution of multiple diversity dimensions of terrestrial mammals and their association with governance and designation types. We hypothesized that different governance types underlie variable management efficacies, such that stricter-managed PAs have better habitats that attract more wildlife, translating to higher species diversity compared to less strictly-managed PAs, especially for focal species groups (large carnivores, large herbivores, and endangered species). The results showed nearly all terrestrial mammals in Kenya represented in at least one PA. However, the relative proportion of represented ranges were low, and analysis of spatial conservation prioritization showed significant expansion beyond current PAs needed to achieve a one third coverage of focal species’ ranges in a best-solution reserve system. Differences in PA governance and designation types were not systematically associated with diversity variances, and while there were more unique species in state-managed PAs than in privately-managed ones, averaged diversity coefficients were comparable between categories. Diversity variances explained by PA size and status year were low in a combined species pool but increased in focal species groups. These findings suggest that success in terrestrial mammal conservation in PAs in Kenya require clearly and formally streamlined definition, performance feedback, and collaboration terms between state-managed and privately-managed PAs. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Aim: Modelling African great ape distribution has until now focused on current or past conditions, while future scenarios remain scarcely explored. Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we predicted changes in taxon-specific distribution under future scenarios of climate, land use and human populations for (1) areas outside protected areas (PAs) only (assuming complete management effectiveness of PAs), (2) the entire study region and (3) interspecies range overlap. Location: Tropical Africa. Methods: We compiled occurrence data (n = 5,203) on African apes from the IUCN A.P.E.S. database and extracted relevant climate-, habitat- and human-related predictors representing current and future (2050) conditions to predict taxon-specific range change under a best- and a worst-case scenario, using ensemble forecasting. Results: The predictive performance of the models varied across taxa. Synergistic interactions between predictors are shaping African ape distribution, particularly human-related variables. On average across taxa, a range decline of 50% is expected outside PAs under the best scenario if no dispersal occurs (61% in worst scenario). Otherwise, an 85% range reduction is predicted to occur across study regions (94% worst). However, range gains are predicted outside PAs if dispersal occurs (52% best, 21% worst), with a slight increase in gains expected across study regions (66% best, 24% worst). Moreover, more than half of range losses and gains are predicted to occur outside PAs where interspecific ranges overlap. Main Conclusions: Massive range decline is expected by 2050, but range gain is uncertain as African apes will not be able to occupy these new areas immediately due to their limited dispersal capacity, migration lag and ecological constraints. Given that most future range changes are predicted outside PAs, Africa's current PA network is likely to be insufficient for preserving suitable habitats and maintaining connected ape populations. Thus, conservation planners urgently need to integrate land use planning and climate change mitigation measures at all decision-making levels both in range countries and abroad. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) exist worldwide to alleviate the gap between human development and conserving nature, history/culture heritage, and resources. In Taiwan, most of MPAs were established as aquatic organism and fishery resource conservation zones (FCZs), such as mud shrimp (Austinogebia edulis) protection since 2006, which we used as a study case. However, comprehensive review has yet conducted to determine whether management objectives are being achieved. We therefore examined the FCZs management effectiveness by conducting a 4 year (2017–2020) field survey of mud shrimp density in the tidal flat and MPA institution in Taiwan. The mud shrimp density obtained from both historical record in references and our observations was analyzed using geographic information systems to determine their spatial distribution within and around the designated FCZs. The results indicate that mud shrimp density is dominant outside the protected zones, which might be related to habitat changes over time. Moreover, the review of MPA governance in Taiwan indicated that FCZs management lack regular financial support and regular examination of management plan. An operational framework is suggested to improve the sustainable management of conservation zones decision-making that comprises four steps: (1) Partnerships with MPA commitment authorities and non-government organizations, specifically, regional fisheries associations; (2) plan regular financial support and fundraise; (3) conduct long-term monitoring programs; and (4) create a coordination platform with stakeholders to evaluate the management plan and/or induce necessary adjustments. This framework will enable users to create strategies that strengthen long-term monitoring and MPA operation maintaining socioeconomic linkages with stakeholders. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Understanding the factors that drive protected area outcomes is critical to increase the success of global conservation efforts. Until recently, our understanding of the influence of management effectiveness has been restricted by the limited availability of standardized management data and study design limitations of prior evaluations. Here we use a quasi-experimental matching approach to test the influence of management effectiveness on forest cover change inside 46 protected areas in Mexico. We test the influence of five management categories, including context and planning, administration and finance, use and benefits, governance and social participation, and management quality, as well as an overall effectiveness score, using a subgroup analysis and an interaction term in post-matching multiple linear regression. Our results show that protected areas with higher management effectiveness have a greater effect on reducing deforestation compared to those with low management effectiveness, but that both types of protected areas experience less forest loss compared to similar unprotected areas. We find this trend in all five of the management categories and the overall score, with administration and finance scores having the greatest effect on forest loss outcomes. Our findings suggest careful design and planning, effective participation from multiple stakeholders and equal sharing of benefits, and sufficient human and financial capital can improve the effectiveness of protected areas in preventing forest loss. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Establishing protected areas (PAs) is an essential strategy to reduce biodiversity loss. However, many PAs do not provide adequate protection due to poor funding, inadequate staffing and equipment, and ineffective management. As part of China's recent economic growth, the Chinese government has significantly increased investment in nature reserves over the past 20 years, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate whether PAs can protect threatened species effectively. We compiled data from published literature on populations of gibbons (Hylobatidae), a threatened taxon with cultural significance, that occurred in Chinese reserves after 1980. We evaluated the ability of these PAs to maintain gibbon habitat and populations by comparing forest cover and human disturbance between reserves and their surrounding areas and modeling the impact of reserve characteristics on gibbon population trends. We also assessed the perspective of reserve staff concerning PA management effectiveness through an online survey. Reserves effectively protected gibbon habitat by reducing forest loss and human disturbance; however, half the reserves lost their gibbon populations since being established. Gibbons were more likely to survive in reserves established more recently, at higher elevation, with less forest loss and lower human impact, and that have been relatively well studied. A larger initial population size in the 1980s was positively associated with gibbon persistence. Although staff of all reserves reported increased investment and improved management over the past 20–30 years, no relationship was found between management effectiveness and gibbon population trends. We suggest early and emphatic intervention is critical to stop population decline and prevent extinction. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Overfishing is a key stressor in many coral reefs, affecting their function and ecosystem services. In the Gulf of California, 50 years of artisanal and recreational fishing have removed most of the largest and most vulnerable fish species, the Espiritu Santo Archipelago (ESA) is a marine protected area (MPA) where artisanal and recreational fishing are allowed in most of the natural reefs, while the artificial reefs (wrecks) are fully protected. An important question under such circumstances is whether artificial reefs can serve as surrogate habitats for the natural reefs. To address this question, we characterized the fish community (species richness, abundance, differences in taxonomic structure) and analyzed the obtained data by multivariate ordination and similarity analysis. The highest species richness was found in the artificial reefs, with total of 83 species, of which 21 species were exclusive. Contrary to the species richness, the total fish abundance was 20% higher at the natural reefs. The fish assemblages of the artificial reefs differ significantly from those of the natural reefs. The natural reefs of the ESA are dominated by few fish species from families of lower trophic levels. In contrast, the studied shipwrecks provide refuge to commercially important fish species (such as Snappers, Triggerfish, Jacks, and Groupers) including threatened species. The different fish compositions on the natural and artificial reefs is likely to be the outcome of differential fishing pressure. The non-fished areas (wrecks) of the ESA may represent a good strategy for reef restoration, enhanced fishing grounds (via spillover) and fishing management. However, the fish community structure of the artificial reefs differs from natural rocky reefs of the ESA, and therefore, should not be considered as surrogate habitats for natural reefs. The results point out the need to reassess the management effectiveness of the natural reefs of the ESA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 2={The Espiritu Santo Archipelago (ESA) is a marine protected area, with the highest fish species richness of all the islands and islets of the Gulf of California (Del Moral-Flores et al., 2013). The ESA is the fourth largest archipelago in the Gulf of California and supports several economic exploitation activities, mainly those related to fishing and tourism, which represent the highest income of La Paz city (Olmos-Mart?nez et al., 2015; SEMARNAT, 2015). It is argued that the implementation of four artificial reefs has served to expand the diving areas and to reduce the impact on vulnerable areas of the west coast of the ESA (SEMARNAT, 2015). However, there is no ecological information on any of the mentioned artificial reefs that support the above argument. Moreover, it is estimated that the actual fishing pressure could be higher since the number of people who perform illegal fishing is unknown (TinHan et al., 2014). Lastly, the current knowledge of the fish communities of artificial reefs in the Gulf of California is scarce.We would like to thank the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), and the Explorers Club Grant (OceanX Grant) for financial support.},

abstract={The Bird's Head Seascape (BHS), Papua, Indonesia is located within the epicenter of global marine biodiversity and has been the focus of recent conservation efforts to protect marine resources. Here, we provide an overview of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) progress in the BHS over the past decade, including establishment history, changes in management effectiveness and ecosystem health, as well as examining trends in tourism growth. While generally viewed as a conservation success story, we reflect on both successes and challenges in the BHS, identifying where we need to continue to improve and adapt in response to rapid economic and environmental change. As of 2020, BHS MPAs cover 5.1 million ha across 23 MPAs. As expected, management effectiveness is steadily increasing in BHS MPAs—although newer MPAs face substantial capacity gaps. Tourism is rapidly growing—with an almost 3,000% increase in tourist visits between 2007 and 2018. Overall, hard coral cover in monitored BHS MPAs remained stable at 33% from 2010 to 2019, although trends in reef fish biomass were more variable. Given continued conservation challenges in the region, BHS MPAs are successfully preventing biodiversity loss while providing ecosystem services for local communities. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={This paper examines governance effectiveness of the Wildlife Refuge of Punta de Manabique (RVSPM), the first recognized marine protected area in Guatemala. The analysis follows the Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) empirical framework through the use of incentives (economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative) that evaluate the effectiveness of governance. Our results highlight that strategic alliances between some local communities and NGOs have successfully provided economic and participatory incentives for better management. However, efforts to develop an integrated or collaborative management system that promotes sustainable resource use across all stakeholder groups have failed. As a result, environmental degradation is increasing at an alarming rate, set against a backdrop of declining management effectiveness. Under this scenario, future prospects for governance should revise participatory incentives and strengthen legal incentives, which should be backed by strong political will. In addition, efforts should continue to foster opportunities for regional collaborations as an essential element for improved governance of the RVSPM and as a foundation to effectively manage natural and cultural resources in the wider Mesoamerican Reef region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Conservation area management includes all systematic efforts, deliberate or not, undertaken by stakeholders in the management of coastal areas in a conservation area. The most useful way to assess management effectiveness is evaluation based on the achievement of objectives set by policies at the national, regional and site levels. The research objective was to evaluate the Bunaken National Park management effectiveness level based on the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) and the Indonesian Management Effectiveness of Marine, Coastal and Small Islands Conservation Areas (E-KKP3K) criteria. This research was conducted from October 2019 to March 2020 in the Bunaken National Park. Data collection employed a triangulation technique with qualitative methods. Based on the METT and E-KKP3K analysis results, in 2019 the Bunaken National Park Agency had a METT score of 77% (good category), and was in the E-KKP3K Gold (independent) category. Community empowerment and engagement is important from ecological and economic aspects, especially as the communities were already living in and around the area before it was declared a marine conservation area. These communities should be seen as an asset whose presence can support the effective management of Bunaken National Park. © 2021, BIOFLUX SRL. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Protected areas are a critical tool to conserve biodiversity in the face of the global crisis of species extinction. Here, we present the first ever management effectiveness assessment of Paki-stan′s Protected Areas (PAs). We link these assessments to the delivery of conservation outcomes focusing on the threatened Western Tragopan (Tragopan melanocephalus) endemic to Pakistan and India. We used two approaches, first mapping the spatial distribution of potential habitat coverage using machine learning ensemble models and second, an assessment of the management effectiveness of protected areas. Our results show that only Machiara National Park scored just above 40% (indicating relatively weak management), 22 of the PAs fell within the 25-50% quantile (indicating weak management), and 3 scored below 25% (indicating poor management). PAs within the species distributional range covered 92,387 ha which is only 2% of the total potential habitat of the Trago-pan. Scoring of Planning element was insufficient both in term of the site and species. Likewise, inputs (e.g., research and monitoring program, staff numbers, staff training, current budget, secu-rity of budget, and management after process) were also inadequate. Finally, we recommend the establishment of more protected areas within the species potential habitat and inclusion of species-specific plans in Pakistan′s PAs management. © 2021 by the author.

abstract={The assessment of management effectiveness during the whole life-cycle process of protected areas (PAs) has become increasingly important, due to the lack of holistic background assessment work on management processes leading to a deeper knowledge of sustainable development (SD) principles. This paper aims to serve as a practical guide through a gradation model of integrated protected area management (IPAM) by carrying out an exhaustive trans-dimensional assessment of management effectiveness, identifying a critical field of activities and developing a framework mix of strategic recommendations leading to the implementation of an effective planning process. Our results could aid in the prioritisation of key decisions towards a more in-depth understanding of how to set up a balanced IPAM, as well as to enable managers and decision-makers to focus on activities that can further pre-established aims and reach the goal of five-dimension-al sustainability in terms of SD and good governance. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Amidst the race of establishing a new marine protected area in Indonesia, the management unit experiences challenges that may influence its ability to achieve the promise to safeguard conservation targets and achieve management goals. The qualitative method applied in this Nusa Penida MPA case study describes the changes in management effectiveness level over the five years of the governance transition. Data were collected through observation, interviews, review documentation, and archives. This study applied the Indonesia MPA Management Effectiveness Evaluation tool launched in 2012 to measure progress over the observation period. This study showed that the governance transition from district-managed to provincial-managed MPA over 2013–2017 Nusa Penida MPA in the Bali Province influences its management effectiveness performance, particularly its ability to achieve output and outcome of MPA management. We found that MPA personnel capacity to interpret the tool itself, poor record and incomplete information transfer will influence the overall score and follow-up for adaptive management. Furthermore, the evaluation tool could not indicate which management aspect may need further action for improvement by which stakeholder for adaptive management. © 2021, BIOFLUX SRL.

abstract={Information on the spatial ecology of batoids is lacking despite the need for this information for effective management and conservation of this vulnerable faunal group. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the presence of dasyatids (Pastinachus ater, Urogymnus granulatus, and U. asperrimus) from March 2014 to November 2017 within and around the isolated St. Joseph Atoll, Seychelles. Results highlighted residency (median residency index = 0.75 and 0.57 for P. ater and U. granulatus) over periods of months to years for both juveniles and adults. Individuals displayed highly restricted movements; most detections occurred within 1 km of tagging locations, and movement networks were small and fragmented. However, juveniles increased their range of movements with size before dispersing to various locations on the Amirantes Bank. Within the atoll, resident adults and juveniles segregated ontogenetically by habitat; adults were more reliant on the deeper lagoon, while juveniles were largely restricted to the shallow sand flats, likely in an effort to avoid predators. Conversely, no inter-specific space partitioning was identified. This study provides preliminary evidence that this atoll is a dasyatid nursery; however, comparative research at other atolls is required to understand the role that atolls may play as batoid nurseries. This study was performed in the South West Indian Ocean, an understudied fisheries conservation hotspot where biodiversity is high but management effectiveness is low. The identification of a dasyatid refuge in this region highlights that the current marine protected area designation will likely provide conservation benefits for the dasyatid populations across the entire Amirantes Bank. © Inter-Research 2021.},

abstract={Over the last decade, there has been a change in the way protected areas are managed across the world, as their management gradually ceases to be the sole responsibility of the government and is being shared with civil society. This study evaluates the management effectiveness, according to the managers and management boards of 20 marine protected areas (MPAs) on the coast of Brazil, using the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) methodology. There were differences in perspectives of the managers and management boards; 8 MPAs showed a significant difference in management effectiveness values, and 11 MPAs showed a change in management effectiveness category. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the year the management board was established, and the effectiveness value provided by the council, as well as a significant difference between the effectiveness values of the MPAs under federal and state responsibility. In view of these differences, it is suggested that evaluations of management effectiveness should be carried out not only with managers, but also with management boards to reduce possible incongruities caused by the responses of only one person. © 2020.

abstract={Assessments of management effectiveness of protected areas offer vital information about threats and management issues at the protected area. However, these assessments are frequently conducted mainly at the internal management level, without input from the local communities that implicitly influence the resources of the protected areas. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of three protected areas in Ghana-Kogyae Strict Nature Reserve, Gbele Resource Reserve, and Kalakpa Resource Reserve-using the Rapid Assessment and Prioritisation of Protected Areas Management assessment tool. The study included workshops with park managers and representatives from local communities, district assemblies, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Poaching, settlements, agricultural encroachment, poverty in nearby communities, and bush fires were identified as common pressures to all the assessed protected areas. The degree of these pressures was influenced by little or no funding, poor community relations, lack of staff and research, and natural resource inventories in the protected areas. Our study highlights the priority of remedial actions that are urgently needed to preserve the protected area resources. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.},

funding_text 3={Additionally, the lack of local community support in conservation and disputes of land tenure was deficient in all the three PAs. Developing and improving the relationship between the PA authorities and local communities is vital to achieving the PA’s conservation goals. Participatory management is, therefore, paramount in the management of the PAs (Kolahi et al. 2013). Collaborative management will protect local communities’ rights and interests and focus on a management body that represents all stakeholders equitably. Generally, the planning element in the RAPPAM methodology has received the highest score in most PAs assessed around the world, including for instance those in Russia (Tyrlyshkin et al. 2003), China (Diqiang et al. 2003), and Turkey (Kurdoğlu and Çokçaliskan 2011). In terms of inputs, the highest scores for Gbele was as a result of external funding from the Sustainable Land and Water Management Project (SLWMP) sponsored by the World Bank and Global Environmental Facility, which began in 2011 and ends in 2020. Kalakpa, which had the lowest management input scores, has insufficient funds, and consequently, extremely inadequate staff facilities and equipment and poor visitor facilities. The primary sources of funds for PAs in Ghana are the Government funds, the internally generated funds from the Forestry Commission of Ghana, and the contributions by the donor agencies/governments. Insufficient funding often creates a shortfall that is extremely difficult to overcome, even when PAs have well-trained and highly motivated staff. According to officials of the Wildlife Division, PAs have approximately 55-60% of the staff needed for effective management. Lack of staff, funding, inadequate facilities, and equipment are some of the causes of poor management in PAs at a global level (Leverington et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Kolahi et al. 2013; López-Rodrígueza and Rosado 2017).},

abstract={Protected areas aim to conserve nature by providing safe havens for biodiversity. However, protection from habitat loss, poaching and other threats, is not guaranteed without adequate investment in their management. Here, we examine the relationship between management effectiveness using the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) and trends of 79 populations of mammals and birds in 12 Southeast Asian protected areas from Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Despite the negative influence of corruption on species population change, we find evidence that adequate financial and human resourcing are important determinants in achieving good biodiversity outcomes. Management resourcing, national government transparency and body size collectively explain 29% of the variation in animal population trends in our model. Our paper contributes to a growing evidence base linking management resourcing shortfalls to declining biodiversity populations in protected areas. Our key findings are relevant to international funding agencies, governments and NGOs, to aid decision making around the allocation of conservation resources in Southeast Asia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ecuador belongs to the group of 17 megadiverse countries on the planet, and the Ecuadorian national system of protected areas covers around 20% of the country’s territory. Despite some initiatives for protected areas management effectiveness evaluation, the information on this matter is scarce and a general overview is missing. In this context, this study aims at investigating problems faced by National Parks in Ecuador and developing a base level management effectiveness evaluation for possible comparative assessments in the future. Focusing on all 12 legally established National Parks, this study used the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), an internationally consecrated methodology based on a scorecard questionnaire that includes six elements of management cycle: context, planning, inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes. The questionnaire was applied to Ecuadorian National Parks management teams through face-to-face interviews. The resulted overall management effectiveness indices are between 40.6% and 99.0%. The general condition of biodiversity value was considered as good in line with the legal status and National Parks design but topics related to budget allocation, tourism arrangements, communities and indigenous people received lower scores. The low enforcement emphasis is not necessarily the best way to improve management effectiveness; the identified issues should be addressed by including communities and indigenous people in the decision making and benefits sharing as well as strategic allocation of budgetary resources, with proper adaptation to Natural Parks’ specific conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Intensifying human-wildlife interaction requires effective human-wildlife management strategies. In India, forests designated as Protected Areas (PAs) have better wildlife protection measures unlike Reserved Forests (outside PAs) which are undervalued, although both support similar kinds of wildlife. Wildlife conservation planning and policy-level decision making become incomplete without addressing wildlife management issues outside PA along with PAs as the former act as a buffer/corridor for PAs. We conducted a semi-structured questionnaire survey with the Forest Range Officers (FROs) belonging to nine PAs and seven outside PAs across the Western and Eastern Ghats part of Tamil Nadu State, southern India. We collected information on the human-wildlife interactions, mitigation measures carried out, poaching incidents, and availability of manpower and resources. Over 50% of the FROs reported an increase in Human-Wildlife Conflict (HWC) incidents for the past five years. Major species involved in conflict in PAs and outside PAs were elephant (Elephas maximus), wild pig (Sus scrofa), leopard (Panthera pardus), bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata), followed by sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), sambar (Rusa unicolor) (more in PAs), gaur (Bos gaurus) (more in outside PAs), dhole (Cuon alpinus), chital (Axis axis), and tiger (Panthera tigris). There were no variations in the mitigation measures employed in PAs and outside PAs. The number of schemes (N = 8–10) available for wildlife management was similar, but to a certain extent, the fund availability was more insufficient outside PAs than in PAs. Tiger (only in PAs), leopard, elephant, and pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) were amongst the fourteen wildlife species poached in the PAs and outside PAs, although wild pig, sambar, black-naped hare (Lepus nigricollis), and chital dominated the list. Prevalent methods for poaching were snares, trained dogs, guns (dominant in PAs), followed by hand-made bombs, poisoning, cage traps, electric traps (only outside PAs), and food baits. Over 50% of the FROs reported decreases in poaching incidences with improved wildlife management strategies for the past five years. PAs had a higher number of anti-poaching camps with anti-poaching watchers than outside PAs. Our study highlighted the disparity in resource allocation among PAs and outside PAs though the intensity of conservation issues was similar. Inadequate availability of resources affected the effective management of conflict species which leads to increase risk of HWC. This is the first study to highlight the success/failure of human-wildlife management depending on reducing lacunas in management effectiveness of PAs and outside PAs for managing at a larger landscape level beyond PAs. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={For almost two decades, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been a central instrument of coastal conservation and management policies, but concerns about their abilities to meet conservation goals have grown as the number and sizes of MPAs have dramatically increased. This paper describes how a large (15 years) program of transdisciplinary research was used to successfully measure MPA management effectiveness (ME)—how well an MPA is managed, how well it is protecting values, and how well it is achieving the various goals and objectives for which it was created. This paper addresses the co-production and uptake of monitoring-based evidence for assessing ME in coastal MPAs by synthesizing the experiences of this program conducted with MPA managers. I present the main outcomes of the program, many were novel, and discuss four ingredients (learned lessons) that underpinned the successful uptake of science during and after the research program: (i) early and inclusive co-design of the project with MPA partners and scientists from all disciplines, (ii) co-construction of common references transcending the boundaries of disciplines, and standardized methodologies and tools, (iii) focus on outcomes that are management-oriented and understandable by end-users, and (iv) ensuring that capacity building and dissemination activities occurred during and persisted beyond the program. Standardized monitoring protocols and data management procedures, a user-friendly interface for indicator analysis, and dashboards of indicators related to biodiversity, uses, and governance, were the most valued practical outcomes. Seventy-five students were trained during the projects and most of the monitoring work was conducted with MPA rangers. Such outcomes were made possible by the extended timeline offered by the three successive projects. MPA managers’ and scientists a posteriori perceptions strongly supported the relevance of such collaboration. Local monitoring and assessment meets the needs of MPA managers, and forms the basis for large-scale assessments through upscaling. A long-term synergistic transdisciplinary collaboration between coastal MPA managers and research into social-ecological systems (SESs) would simultaneously (i) address the lack of long-term resources for coastal monitoring and SES-oriented research; (ii) increase science uptake by coastal managers, and (iii) benefit assessments at higher levels or at broader geographic scales. © Copyright © 2020 Pelletier.},

abstract={Assessing management effectiveness in protected areas is a fundamental instrument to achieve socio-biodiversity protection goals. This study aimed to analyze the management effectiveness of Cunhambebe State Park (from now on, “PEC”) in the State of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, from the perception of stakeholders and the multi-temporal analysis of land use and land cover between 1998 and 2018. We used the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management method for a participatory approach. Seventy-two indicators were used and applied to assess the perception of stakeholders related to the Advisory Council. The management effectiveness of PEC was classified as moderately satisfactory (63.41%). Indicators of “Legal security”, “Vulnerability”, “Site design and planning” and “Financial resources” revealed the weaknesses and threats of management and what should be the priority projects for better effectiveness. Through the multi-temporal analysis, we identified that the advances of pasture and urban areas are the highest pressures and threats, as perceived by stakeholders. In our case study, we provide evidence of actions that must be performed by the PEC management team. These actions must consider the weaknesses and threats presented by the SWOT analysis. Finally, we recommend some political and management measures: 1) Financial resources for the land regularization of areas overlapping with PEC, 2) Guidelines about PEC areas must be included in the Master Plans of municipalities that cover PEC limits, 3) Technical assistance to improve land management, and 4) Strengthen environmental education initiatives at all school levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The global extent of marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased rapidly in the last decade, and monitoring and evaluation are now required for effective and adaptive management of these areas. We classify monitoring in MPAs into four categories and identify a critically important, but undervalued category: human pressure monitoring that targets human activities and their impacts. Human pressure monitoring is fundamental for interpreting the results of ecological performance monitoring and for evaluating MPA management effectiveness. The consequences of ecological performance monitoring that show unsuccessful MPA performance while falsely assuming successful mitigation of human pressures could jeopardize MPA performance analysis and adaptive management, and thus be worse than not monitoring at all. Human pressure monitoring enables using MPAs as reference areas where the effects of global or regional pressures (e.g. climate change) can be disentangled from the effects of local human activities, as well as to minimize the shifting baseline phenomenon in defining healthy stocks. These benefits cannot be realized without active human pressure monitoring integrated into an adaptive management cycle that ensures effective MPA protection. In the absence of human pressure monitoring, all ecological monitoring within MPAs falls in the ambient monitoring category: monitoring that is not intended to measure conservation outcomes. We discuss the implications for monitoring programme design and provide a structure for decision-makers on how to prioritize monitoring activities within MPAs that place greater emphasis on improving MPAs as biodiversity conservation tools over proving MPA performance. © 2020 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

abstract={The effectiveness of a marine protected area (MPA) requires adequate management plans (MgPs), good management performance and effective governance. This study diagnosed management quality on 126 MPAs and 57 MgPs in four countries in the NE Atlantic Ocean (France, England, Spain and Portugal) by adapting the MPA Management Effectiveness Assessment Tool to assess management quality, and management effort, strengths and weaknesses. Despite the fact that these MPAs were, in 2013, on average 14-year old, fewer than 30% showed sufficient management capacity, 18% showed operational management, and only 3% showed effective management. Therefore, 70% could be considered unmanaged or “paper” reserves. Among their strengths, MPAs were in general well legislated in the four countries and had operational management bodies in France and England. However three key factors need to be improved in all countries: (i) periodic MgP updated; (ii) periodic MPA monitoring and assessment; and (iii) education and communication activities. Enforcement should be improved in England, France and Portugal; Portugal and Spain also need to improve the management body and England and Portugal the community participation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={It is widely recognized in science, policy, and practice that protected areas (PAs) that are equitably and effectively managed are essential for halting biodiversity loss. However, our understanding of the relationships between management effectiveness and equity remains weak. Here, we investigate potential synergies and trade-offs between management and equity as well as how they can work together to reduce human pressure in PAs. We then examine the potential of existing global datasets on effectiveness, equity, and human pressure to help inform international policy processes. Our preliminary findings show a negative association between well-defined and sound managed PAs and how satisfied are local people about the decisions related to the management of the PA, reinforcing study of cases that found conflicts in top-down established and managed PAs. We find, however, no association between management effectiveness and social equity with an increasing human pressure. We find only a limited overlap in global databases on management effectiveness, social equity, and human pressure (n = 33). Thus, our results highlight the need to increase the number of PAs with appropriate data about management effectiveness, equity and human pressure to inform policy processes. Without such data, it will be difficult to suggest in honest new quantitative targets for the quality of PAs and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures post-2020. © 2020},

abstract={The study attempts to assess the retreat of a section of a bounding sea cliff promontory, exposed to wave forcing from both sides, of an important Mediterranean sea-turtle nesting beach, within a Mediterranean marine protected area (Gerakas, Zakynthos Island, Greece). Morphological changes were monitored within a 2-year period using a terrestrial laser scanner and the findings were compared with those from historical ortho-photographs to estimate sea cliff erosion the last 20 years. An advanced wave model supplemented by a model for cliff notch evolution, as well as an analytical model were also used to estimate cliff erosion due to wave attack. Comparisons of sea cliff profiles and calculations of volumetric changes using the collected and historical topographic data showed an average annual recession of about 0.16 m for the period 1997–2016. By comparison, coastal modeling estimated a retreat of about 0.23 m/yr, whereas a 0.14–0.3 m/y recession was assessed by the analytical approach; this reasonable discrepancy with the empirical results, is probably caused, amongst others, by the fact that the models does not account for the protection of cliff toes by a constant supply of erosion debris from above. The wave model was also used to estimate sea cliff retreat rates under a 0.5 m sea level rise and showed a fourfold increase compared with the current recession rate. On the basis of these results, as well as considerations related to the seismicity of the study area, it appears that the factors responsible for the sea cliff retreat are wave action, precipitation-induced surface flows, and earthquake-related instabilities that may cause rapid, large-scale erosion. The outcomes of this study are highlighting the critical interplay of several natural factors and climatic change effect on driving coastal erosion, which consequently results in the loss of ecologically critical habitats, thereby challenging conservation goals and management effectiveness. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This study evaluated management effectiveness in three marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation of the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus Linnaeus 1758), located on the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The MPAs evaluated were the Yum-Balam Flora and Fauna Reserve, Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve, and Chetumal Bay Manatee Sanctuary. The extent of the traditional, popular, and scientific manatee knowledge and research were assessed, as well as the prescribed conservation management actions, relevant stakeholders, and the degree of inclusion of manatee species in the management schemes of these MPAs. Four general criteria, 12 specific criteria, and 62 indicators were developed. In total, 199 interviews were completed in seven communities of the MPAs in order to determine the perception of the social, economic, and conservation impacts of the manatee and its management. Although the evaluated MPAs were not wholly comparable among themselves due to their different management categories and schemes, administration, socio-economic context, and the dynamics and conflicts encountered, a comparison was conducted using standardized criteria and a categorical scale in order to evaluate the level of effectiveness of each MPA. The MPA with the highest management effectiveness in manatee conservation was found to be the Chetumal Bay, with an effectiveness classed as good (71%), followed by Sian Ka'an with intermediate effectiveness (53%) and Yum-Balam, also with intermediate effectiveness (43%). The relationships between the key stakeholders of the three MPAs and economic activities such as fishing and tourism are the factors that most influence the effectiveness of management for manatee conservation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

funding_text 1={This study was based on the research and management efforts developed by many colleagues who have studied the Antillean manatee in the Mexican Caribbean region and in the MPAs of the Yucatan Peninsula. We appreciate their work and hope that this study will encourage new and improved management efforts for the conservation of manatees in MPAs. We thank the directors of the three MPAs administrated by the CONANP (National Commission of Protected Natural Areas) for their collaboration. We also thank the local communities within the MPAs for giving us their opinions in the interviews, which represented an important contribution to this work. We acknowledge ECOSUR for providing logistic support to conduct this research, as well as CONACYT (National Council of Science and Technology) for the postgraduate scholarship awarded to the first author.

abstract={Protected areas represent the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation. While their governance can take many forms, optimising their management is essential to achieve their protection, restoration, and sustainable use. This requires that concepts and methodologies are applied in a standardised way in both their financial planning and the management of their conservation actions. In order to describe the financial structure of protected areas in a globally accepted language, the financial information of 19 randomly chosen public Colombian protected areas was analysed and their institutional management actions were standardised based on the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) classification of actions. The financial plans were built based on the budgetary implementation reports, management effectiveness assessments and management plans of each protected area; the institutional management actions were taken from the three components of the current management plans and the institutional policies of the government administrative body. Eight cost categories were standardised from 17 institutional management actions in accordance with the CMP classification; and a total funding gap of US$ 47,547,554 was calculated. Protected areas around the world follow a similar financial structure, however, a wide variety of management actions is reported among them. Standardisation of cost categories according to the CMP classification of actions would support comparative investigations in financial sustainability and allow analyses of the financial needs of protected areas worldwide. © 2020, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={Understanding the effects and benefits provided by the design and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is crucial for developing cost‐effective management actions. We characterized the management and design of no-take zone (NTZ) networks of eight Mexican Caribbean MPAs. To determine protection effectiveness, we followed a two-step approach. First, we evaluated the effect of the level of protection (NTZ, partial and unprotected areas), habitat structure and local human threats on four fish community metrics: total biomass, commercial fish biomass, mean trophic level and commercial fish mean size. If the protection afforded by the NTZ was significant, a second model was developed to evaluate design and management effectiveness. Total biomass, commercial fish biomass and mean trophic level were correlated significantly and positively with no-take protection; and, partially protected areas showed a significant and positive correlation with commercial fish biomass and mean trophic level. MPA age was the only significant and positive design and management characteristic that explained the variation in commercial fish biomass. This might be in part due to the suboptimal design of the MPA network that has mostly resulted from economic and social opportunities with little consideration for ecological guidelines and management capacities. Our findings suggest that to increase reef fish protection it would be necessary to include reef habitats with high coral cover and structural complexity inside NTZs. However, the effectiveness of an MPA network not only requires ecological considerations but also factors that include compliance, enforcement and true community participation to achieve greater benefits. Policymakers must ensure adequate design and management of MPAs in order to improve the effectiveness of marine resource protection, promoting both sustainable use and long-term biodiversity conservation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Global conservation policy requires the scaling up of effectively and equitably managed networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). While progress has been made on spatial coverage, the fundamental aspects of effectiveness and equity are falling short. Past research has focused on management effectiveness in MPAs, but less attention has been given to social equity though it is an ethical imperative and instrumental to conservation. This study assessed the perceptions of SSF regarding recognitional, procedural and distributional dimensions of social equity using quantitative surveys in 11 MPAs across 6 countries on the Mediterranean Sea. To do so, we developed individual indicators from which we created composite scores for recognitional, procedural, and distributional equity, and a combined social equity score. Overall, descriptive results showed that SSF perceptions of social equity were quite varied but slightly skewed towards positive perceptions. Then, we developed predictive models to analyze the effects of geographic (i.e., MPA and country) and individual (i.e., SSF demographics and characteristics) factors on the composite social equity scores. All social equity scores differed significantly between MPAs. Being an older fisher was associated with a decrease in recognitional equity, while having a higher level of relative wealth or more diversified livelihoods was associated with higher scores for distributional equity. These results point to the need for tailored management actions to improve equity in different MPA sites and for different groups. This paper presents a novel quantitative method for using stakeholder perceptions to examine social equity that might be applied to marine and terrestrial conservation initiatives elsewhere. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Numerous protected areas (PAs) have been created worldwide to safeguard wildlife and other natural resources from anthropogenic threats such as habitat destruction and bushmeat hunting. However, conservation efforts in many tropical PAs are still inadequate, revealing deficiencies in management effectiveness. It is therefore important to quantify how different protection regimes impact wildlife within PAs. We investigated the differences between forest mammal communities in two ecologically comparable PAs in the Udzungwa Mountains (Tanzania) with contrasting management regimes. One is a well-protected national park with efficient law enforcement; the other has suffered decades of inadequate protection, mainly resulting in high levels of illegal hunting. Using camera-trapping data, we assessed the target communities in terms of species richness, functional composition (i.e. proportions of trophic guilds) and species-specific occurrences, all while accounting for imperfect detection. We found striking differences between the two mammal communities: lower species richness, alteration in the trophic structure and reduced occurrence probabilities for most species in the forest with high disturbance. The difference in occurrence probability between the two PAs tended to be highest for larger-bodied species. Our results show that strictly enforced legal protection is required to maintain diverse mammal communities in tropical forests under ever-increasing anthropogenic threats. While PAs are the cornerstone of efforts to conserve tropical biodiversity, the future of biodiversity within them is closely tied to the effectiveness of enforcement. © 2019 The Zoological Society of London},

abstract={Protected areas are widely recognized as an important strategy for biodiversity conservation. Most of the sites are, however, poorly managed as resource exploitation by fringe communities and low government funding, among other things, threaten their management effectiveness. We used the World Commission on Protected Areas framework for designing management effectiveness evaluation systems, with the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Areas Management (RAPPAM) methodology as a tool, to evaluate six components of the management cycle at six sites in Ghana for their management effectiveness. We examined the robustness of RAPPAM as an evaluation tool in the African context. The results showed that most of the sites evaluated are vulnerable and exposed to various degrees of pressure and threats, including poverty in the nearby communities, adjacent land-use and encroachment. On RAPPAM, we noted that apart from inconsistencies in some of the assessment scores due to the biases associated with the self-assessment approach of the methodology, the management effectiveness framework places little emphasis on financing and community participation, though both play major roles in the management process. We proposed a modification of the framework within the African context, to address effectively the underlying courses of pressure and threats facing Ghana’s protected areas. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Many large-bodied marine fishes that form spawning aggregations, such as the Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), have suffered regional overfishing due to exploitation during spawning. In response, marine resource managers in many locations have established marine protected areas or seasonal closures to recover these overfished stocks. The challenge in assessing management effectiveness lies largely in the development of accurate estimates to track stock size through time. For the past 15 y, the Cayman Islands government has taken a series of management actions aimed at recovering collapsed stocks of Nassau grouper. Importantly, the government also partnered with academic and nonprofit organizations to establish a research and monitoring program (Grouper Moon) aimed at documenting the impacts of conservation action. Here, we develop an integrated population model of 2 Cayman Nassau grouper stocks based on both diver-collected mark-resight observations and video censuses. Using both data types across multiple years, we fit parameters for a state-space model for population growth. We show that over the last 15 y the Nassau grouper population on Little Cayman has more than tripled in response to conservation efforts. Census data from Cayman Brac, while more sparse, show a similar pattern. These findings demonstrate that spatial and seasonal closures aimed at rebuilding aggregationbased fisheries can foster conservation success. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Protected areas are designed to protect the remaining ecological frontiers for biodiversity conservation. However, global studies claim that the PA systems seem to fail in securing large ecosystem mosaics that are needed to protect threatened and endemic species. There is a myriad of metrices to measure the management effectiveness of protected areas. This review paper explored the use of Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) for assessing management capacity of protected areas in the Philippines and other possible indicators that are measurable and verifiable to holistically assess PA performance. Our review showed the following results: 1) Philippine protected areas showed improvement from poor to fair in METT scores from 2013 to 2017; 2) PA design elements did not fully cover species survival envelopes and suitable habitats; and 3) there was an undesirable inverse relationship between habitat quality and METT scores. To address these, we suggest the adoption of a suite of multidimensional approaches that will take into account a system level performance metric, a performance-based metric, and an ecological/biophysical metric. The combination of these metrics will provide management solutions in ensuring a strategic and sustainable delivery of the twin objectives of the protected areas in the Philippines. © Association of Systematic Biologists of the Philippines},

funding_text 2={Indicators under the ‘Inputs’ element, relating to staff capacity, improved to basic management, while indicators relating to financial security scored below an acceptable level (Table 2). The mean score for #13 indicator (staff number) improved from a low score (0.84 ± 0.64) in 2013 to moderate (1.38 ± 0.77) in 2017, and #14 indicator (staff training) also improved from low (1.21 ± 0.67) in 2013 to moderate (1.71 ±0.88) in 2017. This indicates that increase staff complement and skills may achieve capacity enhancement. The mean score for #3 indicator (law enforcement) also increased from 0.90 ± 0.67 to 1.52 ± 0.86, which suggests that PAs based their scores for this indicator on the numbers of deputized enforcement officers, and frequency/distance of foot patrols during monitoring activities (BMS, Lawin Forest and Biodiversity Protection System). Perhaps limitations of implementation and rollout of training and enforcement activities were connected to constraints on budget and resource management in this case. We noted 45 PAs that rated themselves as inadequately financed whereas five PAs revealed that they have no budget for management. Securing sustainable financing has become challenging because most PAs are reliant on irregular project funding from civil society groups, private stakeholders, and volunteer support from academic institutions. On the other hand, PAs with sufficient budget (e.g., Mt. Pulag National Park, Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, Aurora Memorial National Park, Mt. Mantalingahan Protected Landscape, and Cuatro Islas Protected Landscape) secured their budget from tourism revenues and visitor facility fees to supplement core government NIPAS funding.},

abstract={This article develops a capture fisheries scenario of Indonesia 2045 by using the SMIC PROB-EXPERT method and software. Six scenarios are developed, which are Outward-Looking Scenario (government policy focus on fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone and high seas), Expansive Scenario (government policy focus on increasing capture fisheries production and export from territorial waters), Smart-Fishing Scenario (government policy focus on application of technology 4.0 in managing fisheries), Conservative Scenario (government policy focus on fish stock improvement and marine ecosystem health), Processing Scenario (government policy focus on fish processing), and Subsidy Scenario (government policy focus on subsidies for small scale fishers). Net simple probabilities show that the highest probabilities is Outward-Looking scenario (68%) while combination of 2n (26 = 64) scenario demonstrates that the highest probability is scenario combination of S20-101100 (20.8%) which is a combination among Outward-Looking, Smart-Fishing, and Conservative Scenarios. Meaning that scenario of Indonesian capture fisheries policy on 2045 should focus on increasing fisheries productions from Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and high seas while in the coastal area, government will pay attention on improvement of fish stock and ecosystem health, include improving management effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Regulator and fisheries community will implement smart-fishing concept by applying technology 4.0 in fishing, processing, and fisheries management. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis shows that the prime mover is Conservative Scenario with elasticity coefficient 1.78, followed by the Outward-Looking Scenario with a coefficient of 1.366. © 2019, BIOFLUX SRL.

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) worldwide are facing increasing visitation and complexity. Mounting pressures from the private sector are intensifying the risks associated with overtourism. The increasing strategic importance of PAs for the communities and regions in which they are situated requires improved management effectiveness; yet, recent studies indicate significant and growing systemic risk. Worldview analysis can be a valuable tool for building consciousness and informing the evolution of PA planning and management. Directed content analysis was used to examine two Visitor Use Plans developed for the Coyhaique National Reserve, located in the iconic Patagonia cultural area of southern Chile. The plans were developed using distinct planning frameworks, with different underlying assumptions. Research questions focused on how modernist, postmodernist and integral worldviews were expressed within the two plans. Worldviews were explored in both manifest and latent manners, considering plan text, models and overall context revealing patterns and links between the plans and planning frameworks that guided their development. Rich context and a thorough discussion of methods assists with the incorporation of worldview evaluation within PA management theory, informing the continuing development of knowledge and capacities that can better prepare PAs for future challenges. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Understanding the successes and failures of management of protected areas is vital for the conservation of global biodiversity. The Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) is a simple, questionnaire-based approach for assessing protected area management effectiveness (PAME). Since it was developed in 1999, it has become the most widely applied PAME tool, used in at least 127 countries worldwide. This paper reviews the development of the METT and how it has been implemented and adapted. A combination of literature review on implementation and implementation experience from the original authors and key users of the METT confirms that the METT is a relatively quick and simple way of collecting information about the status and trends of management in protected areas, and provides information to help drive management improvements. As such it is suitable for protected area managers, national protected area agencies, donors, and NGOs aiming to improve area management, and as a component of national reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The paper examines issues related to METT implementation and concludes with 12 recommendations, from using the METT to verification of results, which together help ensure the tool is implemented in the most effective way and improves the credibility of PAME assessments. © Fiona Leverington.},

funding_text 1={In the 18 years since METT 1 was published, it has become the most widely applied PAME tool globally. Uptake has been driven by a number of factors: i) it is relatively simple and cheap to use and easily adaptable to national contexts; ii) parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity have been encouraged to undertake PAME assessments; (iii) the institutional developers of the METT (the World Bank and WWF) have widely used and promoted the METT; and iv) it has been supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) (The METT has been mandatory for use in all projects in protected areas funded by the GEF since 2002; with the assessment carried out at three stages of the project implementation: endorsement, midterm and completion (Swartzendruber, 2013).},
funding_text 2={We would like to thank the many thousands of people who have used the METT and all those who contributed to the METT Handbook (Stolton & Dudley, 2016). Specifically, we would like to thank WWF UK for funding the review of METT implementation. We would also like to acknowledge the developers of the Global Database on Protected Area Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME) and METT database and the data they contain, which was gathered together with protected area managers globally. The data was collated under the auspices of the IUCN Management Effectiveness Task Force, working together with the Universities of Queensland, Oxford and Copenhagen, UNEP-WCMC and with financial assistance from various donors, including WWF and the GEF.},

abstract={Protected areas are one of the key tools for conserving biodiversity and recent studies have highlighted the positive impact they can have in avoiding habitat conver-sion. However, the relationship to management actions on the ground is far less studied and we currently do not know which management actions are the most crucial for success. To investigate this, we studied the effectiveness of the protected area network of Madagascar. We estimated the impact of individual protected areas in avoiding deforestation, accounting for confounding factors (elevation, slope, distance to urban centers and infrastructure, and distance to forest edge). We then investigated whether Protected Area Management Effectiveness scores, and their different facets, explained the variation observed. We found that the majority of the analyzed protected areas in Madagascar do reduce deforestation. Protected areas with higher management scores did not perform better in terms of avoiding defor-estation. We discuss potential explanations for these results, and how they might influence the validity of current methods for estimating different facets of protected area effectiveness under different deforestation scenarios. © The Authors.},

abstract={The assessment of management effectiveness is essential to measure how well marine protected areas (MPAs) are achieving their goals and objectives. Incorporating the view of multiple stakeholders is an important component of MPA planning and management as it may simultaneously help reduce conflicts and increase adherence to rules and compliance. However, the most assessments of MPA management effectiveness is undertaken solely based on managers' perceptions. Here, we compared the perceptions of management effectiveness among managers and the management council members of three Brazilian marine reserves. Council members include stakeholders from the public and private sectors with different backgrounds. Overall, the marine reserves were classified as having medium management effectiveness, with managers perceiving higher levels of effectiveness than the council members. The main differences were related to poor communication among managers and council members and the perception of lack of participation on management decisions by council members. Assessing different perspectives on management effectiveness gives a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Communication between managers and stakeholders is essential to guarantee that management challenges are more equally recognized. We recommend that further evaluations consider the diversity of stakeholders involved in the management to get a more realistic assessment on management effectiveness. The gap between managers and stakeholders’ views is an important indicator because it is related to the level of alignment between MPA goals and society expectations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The management of protected areas and the recognition of a problem regarding its effectiveness are a global concern. Worldwide, protected areas are facing increasing pressures to join human development and biodiversity conservation. There are clear difficulties in connecting use and conservation, and there is also a gap between the planning of objectives and the management of protected areas. To improve management effectiveness, we developed a general framework to integrate the steps into an operational system. This framework was created from a social perspective, prioritizing the analysis of uses and activities, and the territorial conflicts in the protected area. In this case study, we applied the framework to Bahía de San Antonio Protected Natural Area (BSAPNA), Argentina. The results have enabled us to identify four major conflicts that hinder the implementation of the management plan: between uses and conservation; due to incompatibilities between different uses and activities; at the institutional and political level, and due to land-use changes. The framework allows us to define the manifestation of these conflicts in the territory and to identify a series of critical and strategic areas, which are useful to make management recommendations for the examined case. In addition, our modeling approach, that can also be applied to other reserves, provides a solid basis to improve the management of protected areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Misali, an uninhabited islet along the east coast of Pemba Island off the mainland Tanzanian coast, is a biodiversity hotspot and Marine Protected Area (MPA), consisting of a core non-extraction zone (NEZ) surrounded by a larger area where some artisanal fishing is allowed. Within a year of receiving official protection under a co-management agreement, the island underwent a catastrophic bleaching event in 1998, and funding and enforcement in the protected area have been inconsistent since a restructuring of management in 2006. In this study, we investigate current health of the island's fish community, and report 186 observed fish species. We estimate that, including unseen species and those outside the study area, the total species richness may be comparable to the historical baseline of 244 species; however, this represents a decline from the 270 species estimated in 2001 and the 350 species observed in 2004, after several years of successful protections. Patterns of species richness over time likely reflect changes in management effectiveness and engagement of Misali's fishing communities. Diversity of indicator (Chaetodontidae) and keystone (Scarinae) taxa were comparable to historical levels and greatest inside the NEZ, suggesting continued reef health and resilience. However, we found no other significant differences between fish communities inside and outside the NEZ, which observations indicate is poorly enforced, and the disproportionate loss of large predatory fish species may indicate overfishing. The case study of Misali suggests that a temporary reduction in fishing pressure while the island was recovering from a severe bleaching event may have had long-lasting benefits for reef health and resilience. For future management, we recommend consideration of species-specific protections, a possible re-designation of NEZ boundaries to include more unique habitat types, and reintegration of local fishing communities into MPA co-management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 1={Problems intensified when World Bank financial support of the MACEMP formally ended in 2013 (World Bank, 2013). Tourist interest in the island has not expanded as planned, leaving the MPA chronically underfunded (Levine, 2016). Rangers often lack the resources, including flashlights, footwear, working boats, and petrol, to adequately patrol their waters and enforce the law (Daniels et al., 2004; Klein and St. Denis, 2016). Furthermore, the lack of marker buoys or support from law enforcement means that fishermen caught in the non-extraction zone have been able to escape the law by pleading ignorance (Klein & St. Denis, 2016, Suleiman pers. comm.). Pemba's human population has also increased dramatically in the past 20 years (Agwanda and Amani, 2014), and greater demand for food resources and a shortage of employment opportunities outside of fishing for many villages has resulted in increased pressure on marine resources. Therefore, despite Misali's official protected status, the island's fish stocks, even within the NEZ, face increasing pressure.},

abstract={The ecological management effectiveness (EME) of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is the degree to which MPAs reach their ecological goals. The significant variability of EME among MPAs has been partly explained by MPA design, management and implementation features (e.g. surface area, enforcement, age of protection). We investigated EME variability by employing, for the first time, Organization Science. Eight Mediterranean MPAs were taken into account as case studies to explore the relationships between EME and MPA features, such as: 1) organizational size (i.e. the ratio between the number of full-time employees and the total MPA surface area), 2) management performance (i.e. the level of effort exerted to enhance and sustain the MPA management, including enforcement), 3) total surface area, and 4) MPA age. The log-response ratios of fish biomass and density in protected vs unprotected (control) areas were used as a proxy of EME. Management performance, organizational size and, to a lesser extent, MPA age were positively correlated with the log-response ratio of fish biomass, whereas total surface area did not display a significant role. None of the four features considered was significantly correlated with the log-response ratio of fish density. Based on our findings, we argue that the employment of Organization Science in the management effectiveness assessment can assist MPA managers to reach MPAs goals more effectively, with a more efficient use of available resources. © 2019},

abstract={In the world today, where the industrialization of countries is still on the increase, protecting habitats and wildlife will be possible only in protected areas. That is why maintaining species’ diversity and preventing the destruction of habitats in protected areas has been of great interest. Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management methodology is one of the most common methods of management effectiveness assessment and is used as a tool for managers and decision-makers of protected areas. Recently, the biodiversity and sustainability of wildlife populations, as well as preserving the integrity of protected areas in the Khuzestan province, have been at risk due to several factors; therefore, the evaluation of management effectiveness in these areas is necessary. The studied areas in this research are protected areas in Khuzestan province, with a history of more than 5 years of management. The results of this study show that Dez, a protected area with the highest points in the planning (38.5), has the highest score in management effectiveness (128.78). Also, Shimbar, a protected area with the lowest score (11), has the lowest score of management effectiveness (64.66) among the other areas. The overall management level of the protected areas in the Khuzestan province is at the low-intermediate managerial level compared to the global average. Therefore, it is necessary to change the policies and management of these areas. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The importance of management increases in the context of numerous and intensive inner and outer pressures on Protected Areas (PAs). The need to assess the management effectiveness (ME) in protected areas is increasing around the world. The ME assessment helps to improve the management of PAs and to develop a rational, long-term action plan. This study was conducted using the World Wildlife Fund for nature (WWF) Management Effectiveness Tracking Tools methodology (METT) to evaluate the ME of six PAs in central and eastern regions of Mongolia. The main purpose of this study was to assess ME and identify common threats of PAs across different natural zones and administrative areas in Mongolia. The results of this evaluation indicate that, the main threats faced by PAs in Mongolia are: (i) degradation of ecosystems, (ii) environmental pollution, and (iii) habitat fragmentation, resulting from over-exploitation and inappropriate use of natural resources. All six PAs examined have clear management goals and management decision-making systems however, their ME scores differ significantly. This research suggests that the administrative features of the individual PA influence management effectiveness and problems in the efficient implementation of management still need to be resolved. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The necessity to measure the effectiveness of the management of protected areas has been widely recognized. This paper aims to show a realistic state of affairs in protected area management in the Republic of Serbia on the basis of the results of managers' monitoring and their obligations stipulated by law. It will also answer questions on which form of management is optimal, by means of a proposed assessment model. The research has been performed on a sample of 30 sensu stricto protected areas, managed by 21 different managers. For the purpose of ranking and comparing the degree of protected area management effectiveness, the use of a normalized aggregate function (scoring) has been introduced. Results show that about half of the analyzed protected areas have no adequate management in terms of legally prescribed management criteria, as well as that management effectiveness is related to several external factors. The authors conclude that meeting all criteria stipulated by law, and the existence of professional staffrepresent fundamental factors for the effective management of protected areas. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The concept of protected areas (PA) is one of the most widely used policy tools for biodiversity conservation including habitat and wildlife protection. Despite the importance and emphasis placed on protected area management, biodiversity is still in decline and more species are in danger of extinction. Some analyses have indicated that more than 40% of protected areas are poorly managed. To improve management effectiveness, the inclusion of diverse stakeholder information in articulating management strategies has been strongly encouraged; however, stakeholder involvement is often poorly integrated, and an opportunity granted only to select stakeholder groups, with PA staff, especially at lower organizational levels, minimally involved. Further, protected area management effectiveness (PAME) assessments are most frequently used as an aggregated outcome measure of effectiveness but these data should also inform management practice. Thus, for PA managers to obtain a greater understanding of issues impacting their effectiveness, they would benefit from including the voices of staff at all working levels. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to survey 135 wardens and rangers at all organizational levels from the two administrative sectors of Maasai Mara National Reserve to determine their perceptions of management effectiveness and to determine if significant differences existed across staff levels and administrative sectors. Significant differences were found to exist across staff levels and administrative authorities supporting the need for expanded staff voice in establishing effective PA management plans. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The paper presents an assessment of current activities in the management of two Slovak National Parks in the context of sustainable development dimensions and principles and the life cycle of the fields of activity (FoAs). Our results show footprints of National Park (NP) Poloniny and NP Nízke Tatry (NAPANT) management from the holistic point of view of sustainable development in the 21st century. The assessment indicates that the sustainable development dimensions and principles have not yet been systematically integrated into the management of both evaluated Protected areas (PAs), and there is urgent need to increase the management complexity at FoA level, especially in the planning and networking phases, as an aggregate parameter of the new challenges and related requirements for planning, implementing and managing PAs in the new Millenium. Common features were identified in both evaluated PAs that appear to indicate the necessity for changes in the institutional set-up governing PA management which are, however, not within the power of individual park managers; all these features have, as a backdrop, a marked resistance to change in environmental policy at the national government level in the context of PA management. From the results, authors also draw the conclusion that Integrated Management of PAs (IPAM toolbox) promises to be a valuable instrument in the arsenal of the national institutions tasked with protected area management, enabling them to cope with and achieve satisfactory adaptation to the varying environmental and social factors which characterise the 21st century and thus reach their desired aim in terms of a more efficient and effective park management system. © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd.

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) are considered the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation, and their establishment is often used to demonstrate the success of conservation policies. However, despite the increase in number and extent of PAs, global trends of biodiversity loss remain largely unchanged. It has become apparent that simply establishing a PA is not enough, and effective management is equally important for achieving conservation success. The importance of management monitoring and evaluation systems has been recognised by numerous institutions, triggering the development of various conservation performance assessment frameworks and tools, each varying in their accuracy, scale and application. Modified threat reduction assessment (MTRA) was selected to evaluate the management effectiveness of the Letaba Ranch Nature Reserve (LRNR), which serves as a buffer area of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, and two KNP sections bordering it (Mahlangeni and Phalaborwa). The aim of this research was to determine the nature of threats to biodiversity and their changes between 2013 and 2017 in all three sites. The research revealed 13 threats and determined negative MTRA indices of -33.6% in the LRNR and -14.7% in the Phalaborwa section, but a 13.2% reduction in threats in the Mahlangeni section. Combined with the results of geospatial visualisation of changes in threats, we suggest that the LRNR is not sufficiently meeting the objective of supporting the ecological integrity of the KNP, but further exposes it to threats, and that MTRAs can be useful for measuring and comparing threats across PA boundaries. Conservation implications: South Africa has initiated a Strategy on Buffer Zones which seeks to buffer threats to national parks. Evaluating how well buffer reserves function in this capacity is crucial for understanding management effectiveness and resource allocation. Utilising a combination of MTRAs and geospatial tools can assist managers in understanding threats and their mitigation across PAs. © Koedoe 2019. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In 2010 Parties to the United Nations (UN) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) agreed to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss within a decade by achieving 20 objectives that are commonly known as the Aichi Targets. This article explores aspects of Canada's work on one of the few quantified targets (Target 11), which is intended to improve the status of biodiversity through protected areas (PAs) and a new type of designation, “other effective area-based conservation measures” (OECMs). In a faltering attempt to reach its Aichi Target 11 commitments by 2020, some Canadian jurisdictions have elected to focus more on coverage (quantity) and less on ecological integrity (quality), which has significant ramifications for long-term success of biodiversity conservation. For example, a jurisdiction responsible for marine conservation has re-designated regulated fishery closures as ‘marine refuges’ under the auspices of an OECM designation, which brings into question the real intent of Canada's commitment to the CBD and its own Biodiversity Strategy. Ambiguous language used to define and prescribe application of OECMs is being used as the basis for a revisionist paradigm that promises to undermine national and international conservation standards, fracture partnerships, and jeopardize the integrity of Canada's PA network. Canada must reject half measures that will result in ineffective or unintended perverse conservation outcomes, and focus on a post-2020 agenda that prioritizes conservation outcomes, management effectiveness, and the implementation of accountability measures within and between jurisdictions and by the Secretariat of the CBD. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An assessment of management effectiveness was carried out for all the protected areas in the Kingdom of Bhutan. During 2014-2016 the Royal Government of Bhutan developed a custom-made tool for assessing management effectiveness: The Bhutan Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool Plus (Bhutan METT +). This was implemented in Bhutan's 10 protected areas and one botanical park, and the results were verified through field trips and expert reviews. The assessment indicates that protected areas in Bhutan are well managed and there are generally good relationships with local communities, despite an increase in livestock predation and crop damage. However, effectiveness is limited by a low level of resources (both financial and appropriate technical resources) and by gaps in monitoring and research data, which limits the ability to understand the impact of conservation, react to changing conditions and undertake adaptive management to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Bhutan is in the midst of mobilizing considerable conservation funding. The Government is working in partnership with WWF to create an innovative funding mechanism for the protected area system: The Bhutan for Life initiative. The Bhutan METT + study provides an example of how to develop a baseline against which to measure the effectiveness of protected areas over time and assess the impact of conservation inputs. © 2018 Fauna and Flora International.},

abstract={Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are important tools to achieve marine conservation and resources management goals. The management effectiveness of MPAs (the degree to which MPAs achieve their goals) is highly variable and can be affected by many MPA attributes, for example their design, enforcement and age. Another key factor possibly affecting MPA management effectiveness is the management performance, here conceived according to Horigue et al. definition (2014) as the “level of effort exerted to enhance and sustain management of MPAs”. Organization Science (OS), the discipline that studies organizations, can offer a useful framework to assess and interpret MPA management performance. Using an exploratory multiple case study approach, we applied OS principles to 11 Mediterranean MPAs in order to: i) characterize several MPA organizational features; ii) assess MPA management performance (evaluated as the effort deployed in, for example, planning the future, formalizing measurable goals, and implementing specific strategies). Results show that a number of organizational features and networking attributes are highly variable among the MPAs we have studied. For instance, goals are seldom measurable and the strategy to achieve goals is not systematically pursued. Two relevant outcomes emerge from this exploratory study: i) the management performance of the MPAs considered needs considerable improvements; ii) the methods and the approach proposed could help MPAs' managers and policy makers to understand how to improve their management performance and, consequently, their effectiveness. © 2018},

abstract={Yet there is considerable uncertainty over management effectiveness of many protected areas around the world. In this regard, long-term monitoring and management of disturbances in the protected areas need to be properly addressed and documented. The present study is aimed to analyze spatial extent, frequency and distribution of forest fires in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India over four decades (1973–2014). Multi-temporal Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing satellite data were used to quantify forest burnt area. The results showed that the spatial extent of burnt area greatly varied between 1318 km2 (in 1989) to 15.7 km2 (in 2013). The monitoring of fires during the recent decade (2005–2014) was observed to have a gradual decline over the reserve. High frequency of fires has been found in dry deciduous forest followed by moist deciduous forest, scrub, grassland and semi-evergreen forest. Among six protected areas, Bandipur National Park had represented more fire incidents followed by Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagarhole and Mukurthi National Parks. Grid analysis shows that 67% of the grids were affected by forest fires. Large burnt patches have steadily decreased in their size while the other patch classes showed a significant reduction in their size over the study period. This study had revealed the role of climate and accessibility in relation to fire occurrences. Based on historical burnt area mapping outputs, fire hotspots have been modeled to address fire risk zones. Indeed, the Mann-Kendall trend test has indicated that the overall trend of fire incidents have been declining and this indicates the management effectiveness in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aichi Target 11 (AT11) includes the commitment of 194 governments to equitably manage protected areas (PAs) by 2020. Here we evaluate whether existing PA Management Effectiveness (PAME) and social and governance assessment tools can be used to determine if AT11 meets equity goals. We find that PAME assessment conditions are insufficiently inclusive of relevant actors and do not satisfactorily allow for a diversity of perspectives to be expressed and accounted for, both of which are essential for equitable PA management. Furthermore, none of the analysed PAME tools fully cover multidimensional equity and thus they are inadequate for assessing progress towards equitable management in PAs. The available social and governance PA assessment tools stipulate more inclusive and participatory conditions within their guidelines, and the IUCN Governance Guidelines comprehensively capture equity dimensions in PA management, but results are not comparable across sites. We conclude that available assessment tools do not provide a reliable way to track equity in PAs at global scale. The IUCN Governance Guidelines could be adjusted to achieve this goal, providing that the information collected is made globally comparable, while ensuring transparency, accountability and room for contestation, including by communities whose livelihoods are directly implicated. Ultimately, developing and deploying globally comparable measures to evaluate equity is problematic, as the process of gathering comparable data inevitably obscures information that is highly relevant to resolving equity issues at local scales. This challenge must be met, however, if nations are to achieve and report on their success at meeting AT11 by 2020. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Utilization of marine and terrestrial protected areas is fundamentally important for their acceptance and success. Yet even appropriate uses can negatively impact resources requiring managers to make decisions as to when the impacts become unacceptably large. These decisions can be difficult because the level at which impacts occur may be far below the level at which resource persistence is threatened. In Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, managers must make a recurring decision regarding the number of cruise ships that are allowed to enter the park each year. Cruise ships bring >95% of all visitors to the park but have been involved in several lethal collisions (ship strikes) with humpback whales. Using an individual-based simulation model, we demonstrate that increasing the annual ship volume from current to maximum allowable levels would have negligible impacts on population growth of whales. Over the next 30 years the median number of collisions would likely increase from 3 (95% CI: 0–7) to 4 (1–8) or, worst case scenario, from 5 (0–7) to 8 (3−13), while median annual growth rates would, at most, shift from 4.4% (3.7%–5.2%) to 4.2% (3.5%–4.9%), depending upon assumptions. By comparison, a median of 67 (50–82) ship strikes would need to occur over the next 30 years to threaten the persistence of whales. Confronted with an impact level that is far below what would threaten the conservation of whales, managers are tasked with the decision of placing values on 2 million additional visitors for every additional dead whale. We argue that decision-making related to use-impact trade-offs for protected areas could be more consistent and effective if site-values are defined explicitly, clearly communicated among stakeholders, and linked to biological metrics. Protected areas managers can then utilize monitoring programs to evaluate management effectiveness when the objective is conserving both resources and values. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Large (&gt;10,000 km2) marine protected areas (LMPAs) have recently been established around the planet in pursuit of international conservation and geopolitical goals. A recent such initiative in the South Atlantic has important social and ecological implications that have not been discussed in existing literature. In light of this knowledge gap, this article aims to discuss the implementation of MPA networks in the St. Peter and St. Paul´s archipelago and the Vitória-Trindade seamount chain (~1000 km from the Brazilian coast). The participatory process conducted by the Brazilian Federal government created LMPAs networks that integrate multiple-use zones centered on certain natural monuments (islands) and spanning a radius of 200 nautical miles around these islands. With these LMPAs (together covering ~920,000 km2), Brazil increases its MPA coverage from 1.5% to ~ 25% of its EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). However, even with this high percentage of protection, many important coastal ecosystems are not yet protected in Brazilian waters. These LMPAs can be an important step towards the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services of terrestrial insular, shallow, mesophotic, and deep-sea ecosystems. Owing to this importance, it is necessary to ensure adequate surveillance, participative governance, as well as an adequate management plan to deal with the increase in human pressures (fishing, mining, plastics, and climate-change stressors). This paper discusses strategies for the establishment of ocean zoning (including no-take zones) and large-scale marine spatial planning to improve management effectiveness. It also provides insights into the challenges faced in the management of LMPAs in a changing ocean. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study aimed to determine the main anthropogenic pressures and the effectiveness of management practices in marine protected areas (MPAs) (Rocas Atoll and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, South Atlantic). The MPAs exhibited high management effectiveness over the last 25 years due to the control of local pressures (i.e., fishing and tourism). However, the increase in regional and global pressures, such as invasive species, marine debris, and climate change stressors (sea-level rise, extreme events, range shifts of species, warming, and ocean acidification), are environmental risks that need to be considered during conservation. Strategies for large scale marine spatial planning, as well as proposals for an integrated management of MPAs (including coral reef islands and seamounts) by the articulation of a network, which reduces regional human pressures and improves ocean governance were discussed. This study provided insights into the challenges faced in the management of MPAs in a rapidly changing ocean. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Financing protected areas is crucial for guaranteeing the flow of ecosystem services (ES) provided by natural and semi-natural ecosystems, which are the basis of human well-being. In the last two decades, together with traditional conservation tools, innovative instruments, such as PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services), have been proposed and implemented all over the world in order to improve management effectiveness in biodiversity conservation. In this paper we identified and categorized 33 PES case studies in 19 Natura 2000 sites developing the hypothesis that a PES approach may contribute to improving the effectiveness of conservation actions at different spatial and administrative levels. We found that in these areas, farmers and foresters often allow the maintenance of natural and semi-natural ecosystems through their economic activity. Through PES schemes their important role can be formally acknowledged, both in environmental and economic terms. PES schemes are also a tool for involving more stakeholders, particularly local companies, residents and tourists in conservation actions. So PES can actually improve Natura 2000 sites' management and increase the availability of financial resources in favor of conservation actions. However, careful attention must to be paid to the supporting role of public authorities, generally crucial for the success of a PES. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Reef sharks are declining world-wide under ever-increasing fishing pressure, with potential consequences on ecosystem functioning. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are currently one of the management tools used to counteract the pervasive impacts of fishing. However, MPAs in which reef sharks are abundant tend to be located in remote and underexploited areas, preventing a fair assessment of management effectiveness beyond remoteness from human activities. Here, we determine the conditions under which MPAs can effectively protect sharks along a wide gradient of reef accessibility, from the vicinity of a regional capital towards remote areas, using 385 records from baited remote underwater video systems and 2,790 underwater visual censuses performed in areas open to fishing and inside 15 MPAs across New Caledonia (South-Western Pacific). We show that even one of the world's oldest (43 years), largest (172 km2) and most restrictive (no-entry) MPA (Merlet reserve) on coral reefs has between 17.3% and 45.3% fewer shark species and between 37.2% and 79.8% fewer shark abundance than remote areas in a context where sharks are not historically exploited. On coral reefs situated at less than 1 hr of travel time from humans, shark populations are so low in abundance (less than 0.05 individuals per 1,000 m2) that their functional roles are severely limited. Synthesis and applications. Remote areas are the last sanctuaries for reef sharks, providing a new baseline from which to evaluate human impacts on the species. However, there is no equivalent close to human activities even in large, old and strongly restrictive marine protected areas. As such sharks deserve strong protection efforts. The large, no-entry marine protected areas, close to humans, offer limited benefits for reef shark populations, but provide more realistic conservation targets for managers of human-dominated reefs. The exclusion of human activities on a sufficiently large area is key to protect reef shark populations. However, this strategy remains difficult to apply in many countries critically depending on reef resources for food security or livelihood. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Aichi Biodiversity Target 19 calls on Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to improve, share, transfer, and apply knowledge. In this study, we provide an initial assessment of the state of evidence-based decision-making in Canada’s protected areas organizations by examining (1) the value and use of various forms of evidence by managers and (2) the extent to which institutional conditions enable or inhibit the use of evidence in decision-making. Results revealed that although managers value and use many forms of evidence in their decision-making, information produced by staff and their organizations are given priority. Other forms of evidence, such as Indigenous knowledge and peer-reviewed information, are valued and used less. The most significant barriers to evidence-based decision-making were limited financial resources, lack of staff, inadequate timeframes for decision-making, a lack of monitoring programs, and a disconnect between researchers and decision-makers. Overall, our results suggest that the potential benefits of evidence-based approaches are not being maximized in Canada’s protected areas organizations. We propose several recommendations to introduce or improve the use of diverse forms of evidence to enhance management effectiveness of Canada’s protected areas and by extension conservation outcomes.

abstract={Background: Human population growth since the mid-1900s has been accompanied by an unsustainable use of natural resources and a corresponding impact on terrestrial and marine biota. In response, most states have established protected areas as tools to decrease biodiversity loss, being Chile one of the signatories of international conservation agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the 2010 Aichi Targets. This study reviews the Chilean protected areas that have been created to date, with an emphasis on the existence and effectiveness of management plans for all terrestrial and marine protected areas. Effectiveness was individually evaluated using two filters: 1) the age of the management plan and 2) the first four steps of the Protected Areas Management Effectiveness (PAME) methodology recommended by the IUCN. Results: We show that 84 out of a total of 145 protected areas (PAs), and only five out of a total of 20 marine protected areas (MPAs), have management plans. Only 12% (N = 16) of PAs are effectively managed; while in the marine realm, no MPA has an effective plan. Conclusions: Our results show the lack of both the effectiveness of and updates to the management plans for the vast majority of the national territory and raise the following question: is it sustainable to continue adding protected areas to the national system even though it is clear that the existing support is insufficient to meet the minimum requirements for full implementation?. © The Author(s).},

abstract={The Il-Majjistral Nature and History Park is the first national park on Maltese Islands (EU) and a part of NATURA 2000. This paper presents the assessment of the five phases of the park life cycle by IPAM methodology (Integrated Protected Area Management). Il-Majjistral life cycle management varied from weak (34% Networking) to effective (67% Basic planning), with total effectivity 49% showing major deficiencies. About 7% of the evaluated fields of activities showed significant deficiencies across management effectiveness indicators and hence lacking basic requirements to operate effectively and 24% activities were managing marginally. Based on this methodology, specifically recommendations steps with a high priority are proposed to increase management efficiency: overview specific plans, set up indicators of success, monitoring and benchmarking concept, new funding opportunity, assessment of social qualification of staff and their readiness to participate in networks. Expected effects of proposed measures is the integration of assessed area management into regional politics and development, protection and environmental education quality management improvement, public awareness increasement about the complex issues linked with the NP management, an effort to link assessed area management with tasks and tools of land planning and with the European standards and policies. © 2018 Scibulcom Ltd.

abstract={The Sundarbans Forest (∼10,000 km2) represents the only mangrove ecosystem inhabited by tigers Panthera tigris. However, in the Bangladesh portion of the Sundarbans (∼6,000 km2) tigers appear to have declined. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a range of environmental and landscape variables in possible changes in the relative abundance of tigers in the Bangladesh Sundarbans over a five-year period (2007–2011). In 2007, 2011 tiger relative abundance was assessed using sign surveys. Using regression models we investigated changes in relative abundance versus multiple landscape variables (human disturbance associated with villages and commercial shipping lanes, distance to the international border with India where there is enhanced patrolling, presence of forest guard stations, number of criminal prosecutions and forest protection status). Tiger relative abundance was higher in 2007 and declined by 2011 with changes best explained by the proximity to international boundaries. This result might have been affected by the high levels of security patrols at the India-Bangladesh border along with cross border tiger movement between India and Bangladesh. Neighboring tiger range countries could strengthen cross-border law enforcement, increasing protection of dispersing animals. Particularly alarming was the absence of a positive effect of protected areas relative to those outside the protected area system or forest guard stations, implying a lack of management effectiveness suggesting an urgent need for an improved strategy for managing tigers and their habitats. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Current protected area management is becoming more challenging with advancing climate change and current park management techniques may not be adequate to adapt for effective management into the future. The framework presented here provides an adaptive management decision making process to assist protected area managers with adapting on-park management to climate change. The framework sets out a 4 step process. One, a good understanding of the park's context within climate change. Secondly, a thorough understanding of the park management systems including governance, planning and management systems. Thirdly, a series of management options set out as an accept/prevent change style structure, including a systematic assessment of those options. The adaptive approaches are defined as acceptance of anthropogenic climate change impact and attempt to adapt to a new climatic environment or prevention of change and attempt to maintain current systems under new climatic variations. Last, implementation and monitoring of long term trends in response to ecological responses to management interventions and assessing management effectiveness. The framework addresses many issues currently with park management in dealing with climate change including the considerable amount of research focussing on ‘off-reserve’ strategies, and threats and stress focused in situ park management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Protected areas are crucial for biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services (ES), but management efforts seem not to be sufficient. To increase management effectiveness, the ES framework offers new promising environmental governance instruments, however, the operational use is still poorly integrated in the management of protected areas. This study used a framework designed for Natura 2000 sites for effective management of protected areas by valorising ES. This framework was applied to 21 study sites in Italy, and 55 ES were quantified in biophysical and monetary terms. Forty-one payments for ecosystem services (PES) were implemented in a participatory process involving local communities and stakeholders. Assessment of the management effectiveness before and after the implementation of PES demonstrated that integrating ES into the management of protected areas can improve their management effectiveness and contribute to regional development through PES. Based on the authors’ experiences, the study highlights various difficulties and opportunities related to ES assessment, implementation of PES, stakeholder engagement, and monitoring of management effectiveness. It also discusses general challenges related to the operationalisation of ES in protected areas, providing recommendations for science and practice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Non-compliance with conservation regulations is a key issue for protected area management effectiveness in most parts of the world. Effectively managing such behaviours requires a clear understanding of who is non-compliant, what is driving their non-compliance, and what the likely conservation consequences of compliant and non-compliant behaviours are. However, such information is notoriously difficult to obtain due to the (understandable) reluctance of transgressors to discuss illegal activities. Here, we adopt the Kiping social survey method to assess the drivers of non-compliance with resource use rules in two national parks (Catimbau and Chapada Diamantina) in Northeast Brazil. The method is therefore used to support the exploration of suitable solutions for coping with non-compliance on the ground. We found high levels of social acceptability for illegal behaviours in both Parks, though hunting and cutting trees inside the park were viewed more negatively by local residents. Respondents from both areas generally supported the collection of plants and firewood, especially by poor people and local residents. Acceptance of illegal activities was statistically correlated with awareness of park regulations in both parks and, in Catimbau NP, it was also prevalent among older, poorer and less educated residents. To deter non-compliance, a mix of interventions from more coercive measures to softer instruments are recommended, especially in Catimbau NP where the area is not patrolled and the close proximity of indigenous lands gives rise to land- and resource-use conflicts. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={With over 30 years’ experience of managing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), China has established more than 250 MPAs in its coastal and marine areas, but the overall management effectiveness is unimpressive [46]. Recently, China has made commitments to expand the MPA coverage in its waters ([7,52,53]) and develop an “ecological barrier” along the coast by connecting MPAs and islands by 2020 (The State Council 2015). In this context, this study reviews major challenges in current MPA practices in China, including the lack of systematic and scientific approaches, inadequate laws and regulations, ineffective governance mechanisms, conflicts between conservation and exploitation, limited funding, and inadequate monitoring programs. Four scenarios for developing China's MPA networks are developed and analyzed based on a literature review of experience in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and the Philippines, as well as a set of interviews with Chinese MPA experts. These scenarios include: 1) creating a national system with an inventory of MPAs, 2) developing social networks, 3) developing regional ecological networks, and 4) developing a national representative network. The first two scenarios focus on the enhancement of the governance system through connecting individual MPAs as a social, institutional, and learning network, which could provide opportunities for creating an ecologically coherent network, while the latter two emphasized ecological connectivity and representativeness. Given different focuses, they can be applied at different stages of implementation and combinations of scenarios can be used depending on China's needs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Evaluation of the management effectiveness of protected areas has become a global priority, especially in coastal zones, where essential services are threatened by land use pressures. To assess the effectiveness of a coastal protected area, we estimated the land-use change (LUC) within and outside of the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (PCBR) and interviewed key stakeholders to identify the main stressors causing LUC. The native vegetation cover under the PCBR protection decreased by 65% over 24 years; whereas agriculture and livestock lands doubled, even within the core conservation areas of the PCBR. The greatest loss was in the flooded forest (48%), where the reduction was similar in and around the reserve. The effectiveness of reserve management was affected by drivers of land use change, which include agricultural and livestock enterprises that are run by government programs. Effective management of the PCBR has been undermined by poor management practices, limited capacity and resources, and inadequate zoning design. Protected areas and its surrounding landscapes could be considered to be natural experiments for future research, where high value land uses and conservation objectives coincide within coastal areas that will face a predicted sea level rise, more intense floods and higher temperatures. © 2017},

abstract={This paper highlights a disjunction between the basic motivation of conservation planners, policy-makers, and managers, which is to make a positive difference for biodiversity, and many of our day-to-day activities, which are tangential (at best) to the goal of avoiding biodiversity loss. At the core of this problem is the use of conservation measures (inputs, outputs, and outcomes) that do not explicitly address conservation impact, and thus risk undermining its achievement. These measures are used to formulate policy targets and operational objectives, gauge progress towards them, and identify priorities for action. In particular, the pervasive use of representation of biodiversity features as a sole basis for identifying priorities, and the considerable global effort directed towards increasing protected-area extent and assessing protected-area management effectiveness, exemplify that much conservation decision-making is founded more on belief systems than evidence. Measures such as the extent or representativeness of protected areas risk misdirecting conservation actions towards areas of low impact and misleading decision-makers and the public about conservation progress. To promote more effective, evidence-informed decision-making, analytical evidence can and should be used to test and refine decision-makers' implicit models of the world, focusing on predicting conservation impact - the future difference made by our future actions - to increase our effectiveness and accountability. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Protected area management effectiveness (PAME) evaluation is increasingly undertaken to evaluate governance, assess conservation outcomes and inform evidence-based management of protected areas (PAs). Within PAME, quantitative approaches to assess biodiversity outcomes are now emerging, where biological monitoring data are directly assessed against quantitative (numerically defined) condition categories (termed quantitative condition assessments). However, more commonly qualitative condition assessments are employed in PAME, which use descriptive condition categories and are evaluated largely with expert judgement that can be subject to a range of biases, such as linguistic uncertainty and overconfidence. Despite the benefits of increased transparency and repeatability of evaluations, quantitative condition assessments are rarely used in PAME. To understand why, we interviewed practitioners from all Australian marine protected area (MPA) networks, which have access to long-term biological monitoring data and are developing or conducting PAME evaluations. Our research revealed that there is a desire within management agencies to implement quantitative condition assessment of biodiversity outcomes in Australian MPAs. However, practitioners report many challenges in transitioning from undertaking qualitative to quantitative condition assessments of biodiversity outcomes, which are hampering progress. Challenges include a lack of agency capacity (staff numbers and money), knowledge gaps, and diminishing public and political support for PAs. We point to opportunities to target strategies that will assist agencies overcome these challenges, including new decision support tools, approaches to better finance conservation efforts, and to promote more management relevant science. While a single solution is unlikely to achieve full evidence-based conservation, we suggest ways for agencies to target strategies and advance PAME evaluations toward best practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) are being successful in the management of fishing resources and conservation of biodiversity in many parts of the world. The assessment of the management effectiveness provides examples to improve the management of these areas. Thus, this study assessed the management effectiveness of 11 MPAs with reef environments in the coast of Brazil, in the period of 10 years (2005, 2010, and 2015), through the method of Rapid Assessment and Priorization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM). The questionnaire was also used to address the pressure (activities that affect the MPA in the last 5 years) and threats (activities that can potentially affect the MPA in the next 5 years. From the 11 MPAs assessed, the highest values of pressures and threats were obtained for two areas in the year of 2005 and four areas in 2015 (above 35%). The mean management effectiveness between 2005 and 2015 increased from 55.6% (±8.2) in 2005 to 60% (±11.5) in 2015. However, even with this increase, the mean effectiveness of some MPAs is still below the limit considered ideal for satisfactory management (<40%), and the number of MPAs with good management (>60%) has not changed over time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The management effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has gained more and more attentions with an increasing research interest worldwide. An Environmental Performance Indicator (EPI) framework is considered to be a good means for MPAs’ management planning and assessment. As a peculiar type of MPAs with Chinese characteristics, Special Marine Protected Area (SMPA) is still at an imperfect stage in terms of its operation and management in China. There is a scarcity of research evidence of SMPAs’ management and its effectiveness evaluation as well. Focusing on this relatively new research field, this paper aims to establish a conceptual model and an operable EPI framework for examining SMPA's day-to-day management and evaluating its management effects, using Jiaozhou Bay Coastal Wetland SMPA (JZBCWSMPA), the first SMPA of Qingdao, as a case study. The evaluation model and indicator framework are developed via a comprehensive approach taking basic management ideas, international well-known model, widely used indicator frameworks and specific features of the study area into consideration. An expert ranking procedure is also conducted to aggregate the initial indicators. The innovative features of this framework are described, such as it is not only a systematic framework incorporating various kinds of indicators but also specifically practicable for the study area. It is expected that the research outcomes will provide technical supports for JZBCWSMPA's management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) and scientific references for decision-making and guiding for Qingdao's social-economic sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The conservation outcomes of a protected area depend on management actions. The effectiveness of protected area management remains a concern for donors and policy-makers. However, very few feasible methods assessing the ability and performance of management teams have been developed. Behavioral shifts in habitat usage, direct and sensitive wildlife responses to threats, have been ignored in the evaluation of protected area management. To address the technical limitations, we developed a method that uses the behavioral dynamics of target species as indicators of the efficacy of threat reduction, control, and overall management effort. By comparing wildlife behavior with threat avoidance distances and patterns we can examine threat mitigation efficacy as a proxy for overall reserve management effectiveness. Using evidence of giant panda habitat utilization in eleven reserves across Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2012, we built a model of behavior based on the avoidance of four types of anthropogenic threat. We stratified the eleven reserves into five efficacies, of which Changqing reserve was deemed to have the highest management effectiveness. Our approach was validated and supported by changes in suitable habitat and population size across reserves. Focusing on the end result of all threats and management effort means that our framework is straightforward for reserve staff to implement, produces easily interpreted results, and is worthy of application. This study highlights the value of behavioral dynamics when making a full and scientific assessment of the effectiveness of protected area management, and helps investors and policy-makers realize the efficacy of conservation inputs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Conservation managers worldwide need social science information on visitors to protected areas, as well as natural science information on species and ecosystems. Visitor attitudes and behaviours differ considerably between countries and cultures, and these differences influence environmental impacts and management effectiveness. We present the first large-scale multi-site study of motivations, activities, satisfaction and intentions for Chinese visitors to highly biodiverse, heavily-visited Chinese protected areas. At national scale, Chinese cultural attitudes to nature, animal welfare, and threatened species differ substantially from those in Western nations. Our results indicate that these differences are less marked for park visitors than for the general public. The main goal of Chinese park visitors is unstressed appreciation of nature in unpolluted environments, and they also enjoy adventure and cultural experiences. Differences appear only at finer scale, such as wildlife interactions and birdwatching expectations. Since 15% of Chinese park visitors plan their next park visit internationally, these results are also relevant for conservation in all countries that receive Chinese tourists. We suggest that Chinese park visitors might be able to catalyse broader Chinese cultural change in attitudes towards use of threatened species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Protected areas are home to biodiversity, habitats and ecosystem as well as a critical component of human well-being and a generator of leisure-related revenues. However, management is sometimes unsatisfactory and requires new ways of evaluation. Management effectiveness of 36 protected areas in southern Ecuador have been assessed. The protected areas belong to three categories: Heritage of Natural Areas of the Ecuadorian State (PANE), created and funded by the State, Areas of Forest and Protective Vegetation (ABVP), created but no funded by the State, and private reserves, declared and funded by private entities. Management effectiveness was evaluated by answers of managers of the protected areas to questionnaires adapted to the socio-economic and environmental characteristics of the region. Questions were classified into six elements of evaluation: context, planning, inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes as recommended by IUCN. Results were classified into four levels: unsatisfactory, slightly satisfactory, satisfactory and very satisfactory. The PANE areas and private reserves showed higher management effectiveness levels (satisfactory and very satisfactory) than ABVP areas, where slightly satisfactory and unsatisfactory levels prevailed. Resources availability was found as the main reason behind this difference. The extension, age and province of location were found irrelevant. Outputs, inputs and processes require main efforts to improve management effectiveness. Improving planning and input in the PANE areas and inputs and outcomes on ABVP areas is necessary to obtain a similar result in all areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The main objective of this research is to apply the Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MME) assessment for Sabah Al-Ahmad Natural Reserve in the State of Kuwait. During this research, scheduled program has been developed to visit the protected area, in order to identify the current situation. The analyses were done according to the methodology of IUCN. Management effectiveness reflects three main themes in protected area management, these themes are: 1. design issues relating to both individual sites and protected area system (context, planning); 2. adequacy and appropriateness of management system processes (input, process assessment); 3. and delivery of protected area objectives including conservation of values (outputs, outcomes assessment). The assessment revealed that the management in Sabah Al Ahmad Natural Reserve, failed in the achievement of the specific strategic objective as a national park. The failure of achievement of the target is mainly due to the absence of policies or practices related to the application of multi-criteria approach. It is recommended to ensure the application of the Management Effectiveness Evaluation as a multi-criteria assessment technique for the better management based on actual evaluation of the state of management and types of policies and planning in the reserve. © 2017, The Authors.},

abstract={The large increase in number and extent of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) over the last few decades has been an important step towards the conservation of marine environments. However, it is not clear whether these important conservation tools are effectively managed, especially in the developing world where resources are limited and there are frequent conflicts with traditional resource users. An innovative approach was used to identify the most important governance, socioeconomic and biophysical variables that are associated with the management effectiveness of Brazilian MPAs. Management effectiveness data was extracted from Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Areas Management (RAPPAM), applied by World Wildlife Fund-Brazil in 2005 and 2010. This comprehensive dataset was summarized in a single management effectiveness metric and related to a set of 15 explanatory variables using generalized linear models (GLMs). An innovative multi-model averaging approach was employed to identify the most important variables relating to management effectiveness. As a result, five main indicators showed high influence on management effectiveness: 1) higher levels of monitoring/research; 2) higher investment; 3) greater human resources; 4) greater social participation, and; 5) lower levels of conflicts between users and managers. managerial effectiveness of Brazilian MPAs could be significantly improved by adopting an indicator based approach to management prioritization. Specifically, MPA managers should dedicate special attention to the highlighted factors when choosing how to allocate available resources in order to boost the overall effectiveness of their protected area. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper examines the multi-level collaborative governance system in Hin Nam No National Protected Area in central Lao PDR. The paper assesses the governance and management system’s potential as an exemplar to protected areas practitioners, and discusses how such a system might be initiated and replicated elsewhere in the country and the region. Five building blocks of an experimental collaborative governance model are described. These comprise: (i) a participatory governance assessment; (ii) establishing a multi-level collaborative management and governance structure; (iii) participatory zonation based on traditional knowledge and customary rights; (iv) drafting collaborative governance agreements and (v) involving local people as additional protected area management manpower. The inter-linkages between these building blocks are also described. The first results of the collaborative governance approach are encouraging as the total management effectiveness score increased by 13 per cent in two years. It shows that the collaborative governance model can deliver positive results for the entire protected area system in Lao PDR, which is often referred to as a ‘paper park system’. Further work on adaptive management of the collaborative governance system and sustainable financing of the technical field programmes will be required to sustain this model. © 2016, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={There have been numerous calls to ensure that protected areas are governed and managed in an equitable manner. While there has been progress on assessing management effectiveness, there has been less headway on defining the equitable part of the equation. Here we propose a framework for advancing equity in the context of protected area conservation that was developed through a process of expert workshops and consultation and then validated at three sites in East Africa. The framework comprises three key dimensions (recognition, procedure and distribution) and 16 principles embedded in a set of enabling conditions, which we illustrate with reference to case studies. We go on to present the case for shifting the framing of protected area conservation from a livelihoods framing to an equity framing, justifying this from both a moral (normative) and instrumental perspective. Finally, we show how equity relates to a number of other key concepts (management effectiveness, governance and social impact) and related assessment tools in protected area conservation, before outlining a step-wise process for using the framework to advance equity in protected area conservation. © 2016, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered key elements to the achievement of conservation and sustainable marine management targets. Yet, even if recently the number of MPAs has increased rapidly worldwide, the area of ocean under some type of MPA classification is far behind the international targets (e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity) considered essential for conservation of the world's oceans. Furthermore, coherence, representativeness and effectiveness of existing MPAs are largely unknown or even weakly defined. In this study, general characteristics of MPAs from Portugal, Spain and France were collected and used to evaluate conservation progress in this geographic area. In addition, an online questionnaire was administered to the MPAs managers, and focused on multiple processes inherent to each MPA, namely on the characteristics and suitability of planning, management, monitoring, governance and enforcement. Obtained responses were used to calculate the overall level of MPA management effectiveness, and multivariate analyses were used to identify the factors that most contributed to differences in effectiveness. Most MPAs are adjacent to the coast, are small in area (near 50% have less than 20 km2) and were established with multiple goals concerning species conservation and sustainable development of economic activities (e.g. fisheries). Only 9% of analysed MPAs are larger than 1000 km2 and are unequally distributed among the study area. Overall, 46% of MPAs and 59% of total area covered were established during the last five years, while only 3 of the 35 no-take areas (22% in area) were implemented during this period. High MPA effectiveness (i.e. the extent to which an MPA is protecting values and achieving its goals and objectives) was related with high levels of stakeholders support, with suitable goals, management and enforcement. Results highlighted the need to improve MPA coverage taking into account other existing MPAs to increase coherence and representativeness of networks, that new no-take areas should be implemented in key conservation sites and that management strategies (e.g. enforcement and monitoring) should be strengthened. These findings are applicable to the study area yet methodology and outcomes are pertinent to MPA management worldwide. Ultimately, strategies aiming at maximizing MPA performance are probably as important as the increase of MPA coverage. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Brazil has one of the largest protected areas (PA) systems in the world but just a small fraction is devoted to the protection of marine habitats. The effectiveness and integrity of PA are being challenged and questioned worldwide and this situation is not different in Brazil. Poorly managed PA are more vulnerable to habitat loss, poaching and other threats. Alarmingly, studies have shown that just a fraction of the current PA can be considered effectively managed. Facing such scenario, studies on the effectiveness of the management of PA - and especially marine PA (MPA)- become essential to enhance the role these areas play in biodiversity conservation, as well as provide useful tools for managers and decision-makers. Using the Rapid Assessment and Priorization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) methodology, we evaluated the management effectiveness of the largest MPA in Brazil, the Environmental Protected Area Costa dos Corais (APACC, IUCN category V). In a rare opportunity in the context of Brazil's PA system, we were able to access the management effectiveness of APACC over a 15-year period, tracking progresses, identifying strengthens and weaknesses experienced. The overall management effectiveness of APACC has improved over the last 15 years. Although there were variations, five out of 14 indicators analyzed presented improvements while nine remained stable over the years. Finance was the module that contributed the most for the general improvement of APACC. Contrary to many other PA worldwide, which face budget restrictions, APACC's financial situation is currently stable and such stability may have had a positive effect on other management modules, like Infrastructure and Outputs. Research, Monitoring and Evaluation was among modules with slower progress, which is a contradiction considering APACC is amongst the Brazilian MPA with more research. The feedback from researchers is considered poor and most of the research conducted considered not useful for management purposes. Tourism has the highest increase in criticality, being not only the biggest pressure, but also the main threat. Considering that there were improvements in other areas, increasing APACC's limited staff should be a priority for the coming years. RAPPAM proved to be a quick and easy-to-apply methodology, making it effective for temporal analysis on the management of MPA. However, caution is necessary when analyzing some of RAPPAM results. Frequent changes in the management staff, poor records of the management process and the activities adopted, and incomplete transference of information between staff members inevitably compromises the answers and the overall accuracy. RAPPAM needs in loco validation of the answers and this could be a time consuming process for large PA. For better results, RAPPAM could and should be applied together with other evaluation methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A new perspective for the management effectiveness of protected areas needs the inclusion of social data for decision-making. In this process, environmental education (EE) plays a key role in catalyzing biological and social issues in the management process, but there are scarce data about this relationship. The objective of this paper is to develop, from an institutional bottom-up perspective, a proposal for a set of EE indicators that is easy to use by practitioners to measure the response of the EE program in relation to the conservation objectives of protected areas management plans. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques, a case study at the National Parks System of Colombia is presented, which is divided in five stages: 1. An EE evaluation survey on a national scale. 2. An interview phase with EE practitioners and NGOs. 3. EE objectives categorization. 4. Systematization process and 5. Focus group to evaluate the proposed set of indicators. A set of 5 EE indicators was developed to fulfill the identified needs: appropriation of information, articulation, participation quality, program implementation and continuity of EE process. We expect that this new approach for EE evaluation will hopefully be adopted in the update of management plans, as an innovative tool that contributes to the effectiveness assessment of protected areas, integrating a more social and participative focus. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Creating protected areas (PAs) intended to counteract the effects of human activities on the environment is a significant step towards conserving coastal and marine ecosystems. Various countries have introduced legal mechanisms to create and manage their important ecosystems, such as mangroves. Despite the significance of evaluating the effectiveness of PAs, literature on the topic is scarce, especially pertaining to the mangrove ecosystems. Therefore, the present study intended to evaluate the management of a PA located in northeastern Brazil throughout the first decade of the current century (2003, 2006, and 2012). The management of the PA was considered inadequate, and the level of efficacy even declined progressively, although a slight improvement was recorded in 2006. The respective levels of effectiveness were 35%, 50%, and 15% for 2003, 2006, and 2012. The improvement recorded in 2006 was attributed to a new management plan and the ensuing environmental actions, such as monitoring and management programs, PA zoning, and others. The worst management performance was indicated for the following assessment parameters, namely, administrative matters (public administration), biogeographic characteristics, and threats. One of the main reasons for the low management effectiveness is that the mangrove PA is located in an urban area of one the most densely populated cities in Brazil, namely, Fortaleza, (7786 inhabitant/km2). The location has led to an increase in the number of threats to the PA and has strongly influenced the biogeographic characteristics. The urbanization in and around the area has resulted in the PA being isolated, with no connection to other ecosystems through ecological corridors. Both direct measures and strategic planning are required to facilitate continuous improvement of the management effectiveness of PAs. This strategy is imperative in countries with tropical ecosystems characterized by significant biodiversity, which is vulnerable to anthropogenic effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity urges, inter alia, that nations protect at least 17 % of their land, and that protection is effective and targets areas of importance for biodiversity. Five years before reporting on Aichi targets is due, we assessed the Philippines’ current protected area system for biodiversity coverage, appropriateness of management regimes and capacity to deliver protection. Although protected estate already covers 11 % of the Philippines’ land area, 64 % of its key biodiversity areas (KBAs) remain unprotected. Few protected areas have appropriate management and governance infrastructures, funding streams, management plans and capacity, and a serious mismatch exists between protected area land zonation regimes and conservation needs of key species. For the Philippines to meet the biodiversity coverage and management effectiveness elements of Aichi Target 11, protected area and KBA boundaries should be aligned, management systems reformed to pursue biodiversity-led targets and effective management capacity created. © 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={The management success of a marine protected area (MPA) is essentially a social construct because people have differing views on what defines success. Conflicting opinions between stakeholders need to be identified and resolved to ensure these factors do not interfere with successful functioning of MPAs. This study looked at developing and prioritizing performance indicators for Maria Island Marine Nature Reserve (MIMNR), Australia. Performance indicators were developed for MIMNR based on an expert-led, structured framework and then prioritized using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), with respect to input from key informants of stakeholder groups. Results showed that all stakeholder groups agreed that management of MIMNR should first focus on “abundance and size of native species,” and that managers, fishers, and environmental nongovernmental organizations place a significantly higher priority on ecological over socioeconomic and governance performance indicators. Researchers placed even emphasis across all priorities. Results suggest that MIMNR should first focus on monitoring “abundance and size of native species” and demonstrates the capacity of the AHP to increase management effectiveness and improve the decision-making process. Furthermore, by identifying where discrepancies in preferences exist, the outcomes of this research can be used to enhance collaboration among stakeholders. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Marine Protected Area (MPA) Anambas is a conservation area under the governance of LOKA KKPN Pekanbaru, Riau Province with potential types of ecosystems and abundant fish resources. The existence and sustainability of fish resources is one of the keys to successful fisheries management in the Anambas MPA as newly defined conservation area. Therefore the evaluation needs evaluation for fisheries condition and status of marine protected area performance management. This study aims to evaluate and compare the assessment of fisheries management status using Ecosystem Approach for Fisheries Management (EAFM) indicator and Effectiveness status using Management effectiveness of Aquatic, coastal and small Island Conservation Area (E-KKP3K) in MPA Anambas. Assessment of EAFM indicators result aggregate value is equal to 211. It means, the condition of Anambas Marine Protected Area included in good category. While the results of performance evaluation using E-KKP3K are on green rankings because all questions are answered in the green ranks. It means, Anambas Marine Protected Area has managed with minimum as newly established MPA. The Management strategy carried out on indicators of fish resources, habitats and ecosystems, fisheries technology, economic, social and institutional are in bad and medium category. © 2015, BIOFLUX SRL.

abstract={Protected area coverage has reached over 15% of the global land area. However, the quality of management of the vast majority of reserves remains unknown, and many are suspected to be "paper parks". Moreover, the degree to which management can be enhanced through targeted conservation projects remains broadly speculative. Proven links between improved reserve management and the delivery of conservation outcomes are even more elusive. In this paper we present results on how management effectiveness scores change in protected areas receiving conservation investment, using a globally expanded database of protected area management effectiveness, focusing on the "management effectiveness tracking tool" (METT). Of 1934 protected areas with METT data, 722 sites have at least two assessments. Mean METT scores increased in 69.5% of sites while 25.1% experienced decreases and 5.4% experienced no change over project periods (median 4. years). Low initial METT scores and longer implementation time were both found to positively correlate with larger increases in management effectiveness. Performance metrics related to planning and context as well as monitoring and enforcement systems increased the most while protected area outcomes showed least improvement. Using a general linear mixed model we tested the correlation between change in METT scores and matrices of 1) landscape and protected area properties (i.e. topography and size), 2) human threats (i.e. road and human population density), and 3) socio-economics (i.e. infant mortality rate). Protected areas under greater threat and larger protected areas showed greatest improvements in METT. Our results suggest that when funding and resources are targeted at protected areas under greater threat they have a greater impact, potentially including slowing the loss of biodiversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Driven by the underperformance of many protected areas (PAs), protected area management effectiveness (PAME) evaluations are increasingly being conducted to assess PAs in meeting specified objectives. A number of PAME tools have been developed, many of which are based on the IUCN-WCPA framework constituting six evaluative elements (context, planning, input, process, output, and outcomes). In a quest for a more universal tool and using this framework, Leverington et al. (Environ Manag 46(5):685–698, 2010) developed a common scale and list of 33 headline indicators, purported to be representative across a wide range of management effectiveness evaluation tools. The usefulness of such composite tools and the relative weighting of indicators are still being debated. Here, we utilize these headline indicators as a benchmark to assess PAME in 37 PAs of four types in Krasnoyarsk Kray, Russia, and compare these with global results. Moreover, we review the usefulness of these indicators in the Krasnoyarsk context based on the opinions of local PA management teams. Overall, uncorrected management scores for studied PAs were slightly better (mean = 5.66 ± 0.875) than the global average, with output and outcome elements being strongest, and planning and process scores lower. Score variability is influenced by PA size, location, and type. When scores were corrected based on indicator importance, the mean score significantly increased to 5.75 ± 0.858. We emphasize idiosyncrasies of Russian PA management, including the relative absence of formal management plans and limited efforts toward local community beneficiation, and how such contextual differences may confound PAME scores when indicator weights are treated equal. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={If parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and their partners are to report effectively on progress against national, regional and global biodiversity conservation goals, data will need to be collected at multiple levels. Global data sets, many gathered using remote sensing, offer partial solutions but need to be complemented by field-level observations to provide the resolution necessary to track conservation measures in a meaningful way. This paper summarises efforts made by the conservation organisation WWF, working with partners, to integrate 10 indicators of relevance to CBD parties into its global monitoring system and to use global data sets and data from field programmes to determine progress against multi-level goals and to assess programme performance and impacts. Integration of in-situ and ex-situ data into reporting dashboards tailored to WWF’s needs allowed some degree of assessment of progress and adaptive management of the programme portfolio. Indicator trends were most favourable (on track) for protected area (PA) coverage and market share of sustainable commodities, and least favourable (worsening) for species offtake, species populations, wildlife trade, habitat fragmentation and Ecological Footprint. The most useful indicators – which could be disaggregated to provide trends at local levels relevant to WWF field programmes – were species populations, habitat cover and fragmentation, PA coverage and PA management effectiveness. However challenges remain if local and global monitoring objectives are to be aligned, including the need for increased collection of data by field projects, improved harmonisation of indicators, and greater sharing of data in formats of use to practitioners. We advocate wider adoption by governments and civil society organisations of indicators with the dual function of tracking delivery of CBD Aichi Targets as well as monitoring national, regional and ecoregional level conservation programmes, and urge more NGOs and academic bodies to support capacity building and data collection. © 2015 Biodiversity Conservancy International.},

abstract={Protected areas are vital to sustain a number of ecosystem services. Yet, many protected areas are underfinanced and lack management effectiveness. Protected area certificates have been suggested as a way to resolve these problems. This instrument would allow land managers to certify an area if it meets certain conservation criteria. The certificates could then be sold on an international market, for example to companies and any consumers that are interested in environmental protection. Some pilot initiatives have been launched, yet little is known about future demand and features of protected area certificates. To fill this knowledge gap, we conduct a choice experiment with close to 400 long-distance tourists from Germany as a potential group of buyers. Our results indicate that the respondents have the highest willingness to pay for certificates that conserve sensitive ecosystems and in addition to this lead to poverty reduction and safeguard water resources. For other attributes such as a greenhouse gas reduction, the preferences are less significant. Overall, the results are rather homogenous irrespective of where the protected areas are located. These insights are important for the future design and marketing of protected area certificates. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Fisheries is a vital sector in the Philippine economy, providing a significant source of both domestic and export earnings while meeting essential food security and nutritional requirements. However, marine resources in the Philippines are facing increasing pressure from overfishing, destructive fishing practices, habitat destruction, declining water quality and limited management capacity. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are part of the management strategy to address these issues but the majority of MPAs around the world do not meet their management objectives. This paper discusses the identification and testing of management effectiveness indicators to evaluate MPA management for seven sites in the Philippines. The selection of 14 indicators was a participatory process that involved representatives from the academe, civil society groups, fishing associations, local government units (LGUs), national government agencies and research institutions. Overall, the majority of the indicators are rated positive but there is significant room for improvement, particularly in areas of resource use conflict, availability and allocation of resources and interaction between MPA managers and stakeholders. It is imperative that MPAs across the Philippines be managed and implemented as a network to maximize conservation and fisheries management. Moreover, given that the Philippines lies in the Coral Triangle area of the highest marine biodiversity in the world, increased political will and support for MPAs is urgently needed to meet global marine biodiversity targets and allow the Philippines to be an example of effective marine biodiversity conservation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A rapid assessment of management effectiveness was undertaken for the Zhangye National Wetland Park, a small, remote protected area in Gansu Province, the People’s Republic of China (PRC). During site visits and a workshop with park personnel in 2011, park management activities were documented and the first baseline score of management effectiveness was derived. The park exhibits similar trends to many other protected areas in the PRC and globally, with legal establishment, design and objectives, and economic benefits reported as management strengths, and budget security, monitoring and evaluation, and law enforcement reported as management weaknesses. Specific challenges for the park include a need to balance the development of tourism infrastructure with biodiversity conservation, and to develop quantitative management targets linked to conservation objectives. © 2015, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={Nigeria like other countries has experienced rapid increase in number and sizes of protected areas in the last century. As a result, a number of policies, agencies and departments were established to ensure proper protection and management of these areas. To ensure management effectiveness, frequent evaluation is necessary. This paper is a review of relevant literatures on protected area management effectiveness and collaboration in management. The findings of the review indicated that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) framework is the most widely used for assessing management effectiveness of protected areas. However, a limitation of the framework is its deficiency to integrate collaboration and motivation. These factors play vital roles in effective management of protected areas through promoting wildlife conservation particularly in developing world. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid framework for evaluating protected area management effectiveness, consisting of the IUCN framework, collaboration and motivation to be used in subsequent assessment of protected areas. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

abstract={Protected area management agencies are increasingly using management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) to better understand, learn from and improve conservation efforts around the globe. Outcome assessment is the final stage of MEE, where conservation outcomes are measured to determine whether management objectives are being achieved. When quantitative monitoring data are available, bestpractice examples of outcome assessments demonstrate that data should be assessed against quantitative condition categories. Such assessments enable more transparent and repeatable integration of monitoring data into MEE, which can promote evidence-based management and improve public accountability and reporting. We interviewed key informants from marine protected area (MPA) management agencies to investigate how scientific data sources, especially long-term biological monitoring data, are currently informing conservation management. Our study revealed that even when long-term monitoring results are available, management agencies are not using them for quantitative condition assessment in MEE. Instead, many agencies conduct qualitative condition assessments, where monitoring results are interpreted using expert judgment only. Whilst we found substantial evidence for the use of long-term monitoring data in the evidence-based management of MPAs, MEE is rarely the sole mechanism that facilitates the knowledge transfer of scientific evidence to management action. This suggests that the first goal of MEE (to enable environmental accountability and reporting) is being achieved, but the second and arguably more important goal of facilitating evidence-based management is not. Given that many MEE approaches are in their infancy, recommendations are made to assist management agencies realize the full potential of long-term quantitative monitoring data for protected area evaluation and evidence-based management. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Recent international policy developments require states to conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas by creating effectively managed and ecologically coherent networks of protected areas in the marine environment. In the framework of the PANACHE project, the current status of designation, management and monitoring of the network of marine protected areas (MPAs) of an important environmental, social and economic marine area: the English Channel (the Channel) was examined. Currently 224 MPAs exist belonging to 12 different designation categories and covering 17440km2, or approximately 20.3% of the project area in the Channel. International protection targets in the marine environment are thus met at this regional scale, although the individual contributions of the UK and France are considerably different, with French MPAs accounting for nearly 80% of the total area protected. Differences between countries are also found regarding MPA designation categories (11 in France, 6 in the UK, 1 in the Channel Islands) and management structures (with more actors involved in the UK) and approach, whereas the monitoring techniques used are similar, although more standardised in the UK. Pending challenges include greater within-country and cross-country MPA designation, monitoring and management simplicity, integration and coordination as well as the assessment of management effectiveness and ecological coherence of the Channel network of MPAs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Numerous protected areas (PAs) have been created in Africa to safeguard wildlife and other natural resources. However, significant threats from anthropogenic activities and decline of wildlife populations persist, while conservation efforts in most PAs are still minimal. We assessed the impact level of the most common threats to wildlife within PAs in tropical Africa and the relationship of conservation activities with threat impact level. We collated data on 98 PAs with tropical forest cover from 15 countries across West, Central and East Africa. For this, we assembled information about local threats as well as conservation activities from published and unpublished literature, and questionnaires sent to long-term field workers. We constructed general linear models to test the significance of specific conservation activities in relation to the threat impact level. Subsistence and commercial hunting were identified as the most common direct threats to wildlife and found to be most prevalent in West and Central Africa. Agriculture and logging represented the most common indirect threats, and were most prevalent in West Africa. We found that the long-term presence of conservation activities (such as law enforcement, research and tourism) was associated with lower threat impact levels. Our results highlight deficiencies in the management effectiveness of several PAs across tropical Africa, and conclude that PA management should invest more into conservation activities with long-term duration.

abstract={Deforestation in the biosphere reserves, which are key Protected Areas has negative impacts on biodiversity, climate, carbon fluxes and livelihoods. Comprehensive study of deforestation in biosphere reserves is required to assess the impact of the management effectiveness. This article assesses the changes in forest cover in various zones and protected areas of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first declared biosphere reserve in India which forms part of Western Ghats-a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have mapped the forests from earliest available topographical maps and multi-temporal satellite data spanning from 1920’s to 2012 period. Mapping of spatial extent of forest cover, vegetation types and land cover was carried out using visual interpretation technique. A grid cell of 1 km × 1 km was generated for time series change analysis to understand the patterns in spatial distribution of forest cover (1920–1973–1989–1999–2006–2012). The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be 5,806.5 km2 (93.8 % of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as 1,423.6 km2 (24.5 % of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of >0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during 1920–1973. The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of >75 ha of forest loss during 1920–1973 while, only 15 grids have shown >75 ha loss during 1973–1989. Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically reduced after the declaration due to high degree of protection, thus indicating the secure future of reserve in the long term under the current forest management practices. The present work will stand as the most up-to-date assessment on the forest cover of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with immediate applications in monitoring and management of forest biodiversity. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={The Global Conservation Fund (GCF) is a global programme intended to address the problems associated with protected areas that lack sufficient resources to function effectively. In operation since 2001, GCF has built a global portfolio of over 65 protected area investments linked to a comprehensive integrated data set on protected area management effectiveness and conservation outcomes. With data collected over the last six years (2008-2013), this paper attempts to answer two questions: 1) What is the relationship between conservation investments and the enabling conditions needed to achieve conservation outcomes? 2) Does stable funding correlate with a stable or improving deforestation rate? Results from analysis of this data suggest that regular, sustained investment in protected area management resulted in a statistically significant decline in deforestation rates in and around these protected areas. Additionally, we find that higher scores on management effectiveness were associated with lower deforestation rates. This suggests that monitoring the enabling conditions for effective protected area management provides a reasonable proxy for conservation outcomes as measured by changes in deforestation rates. These results make a compelling argument that Conservation Trust Funds are valuable tools to help protected areas deliver on their objectives and contribute to global conservation targets. © 2018, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={We studied the effectiveness of protected area management within a Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) priority place for conservation investment, located in the coastal areas of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. At least 473 sites in this region have completed Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) assessments since 2003, often associated with Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded projects, but also through work funded by other donors and WWF itself. We show that community managed reserves score higher using the METT tool when compared with sites managed by the state forest agencies. We situate this within the context of approaches to reserve management in Tanzania, where state-managed Forest Reserves have received little in terms of funding support and score lowest when compared with all other management types in Tanzania. Further, we show that slightly higher average METT scores for sites where WWF are working across Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique, when compared with all other sites, are most pronounced in elements of the METT tool relating to inputs, process and planning, and are not seen in outputs or outcomes. We discuss the utility of the METT tool for organisations like WWF to evaluate their impact in protected area management, including the issue of systematic bias in data recording (WWF facilitation of assessments) and that more time may be required to see the outcomes and impacts from any management improvements that have been achieved. © 2018, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={Evaluating the effectiveness of protected area management to help improve management outcomes is becoming an increasingly common practice. The evaluation tools developed and implemented in over 100 countries generally rely on the expert judgements of protected area managers. Despite the growing collection and use of management effectiveness evaluation data, there have been no previous attempts to measure the accuracy of these data. We measured the accuracy of managers' judgements about the conditions in their reserves by collecting independent field data. We also assessed how accurately the evaluation tool reflected managers' views by conducting semi-structured interviews with 23 protected area managers from New South Wales, Australia. We found that managers made highly accurate judgements of the extent of a common weed species, Rubus fruticosus (blackberry), but often misinterpreted the scope, scale and timeframe of the evaluation. These framing effects can lead to error being introduced into the evaluation dataset, affecting the precision of evaluations such that they cannot be reliably compared among reserves. We suggest that the wording of evaluation questions needs to be explicit about the assessment frame to minimize the influence of framing effects on management effectiveness evaluations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Coral reefs and associated fish populations have experienced rapid decline in the Caribbean region and marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely implemented to address this decline. The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape. A re-scaling of our perception of Caribbean reef fish mobility and habitat use is imperative, with important implications for ecology and management effectiveness. © 2014 Pittman et al.},

abstract={The African lion has declined to &lt;35,000 individuals occupying 25% of its historic range. The situation is most critical for the geographically isolated populations in West Africa, where the species is considered regionally endangered. Elevating their conservation significance, recent molecular studies establish the genetic distinctiveness of West and Central African lions from other extant African populations. Interventions to save West African lions are urgently required. However formulating effective conservation strategies has been hampered by a lack of data on the species' current distribution, status, and potential management deficiencies of protected areas (PAs) harboring lions. Our study synthesized available expert opinion and field data to close this knowledge gap, and formulate recommendations for the conservation of West African lions. We undertook lion surveys in 13 large (&gt;500 km2) PAs and compiled evidence of lion presence/absence for a further eight PAs. All PAs were situated within Lion Conservation Units, geographical units designated as priority lion areas by wildlife experts at a regional lion conservation workshop in 2005. Lions were confirmed in only 4 PAs, and our results suggest that only 406 (273-605) lions remain in West Africa, representing &lt;250 mature individuals. Confirmed lion range is estimated at 49,000 km2, or 1.1% of historical range in West Africa. PAs retaining lions were larger than PAs without lions and had significantly higher management budgets. We encourage revision of lion taxonomy, to recognize the genetic distinctiveness of West African lions and highlight their potentially unique conservation value. Further, we call for listing of the lion as critically endangered in West Africa, under criterion C2a(ii) for populations with &lt;250 mature individuals. Finally, considering the relative poverty of lion range states in West Africa, we call for urgent mobilization of investment from the international community to assist range states to increase management effectiveness of PAs retaining lions. © 2014 Henschel et al.},

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) have the potential to conserve marine resources as well as provide social and economic benefits to local communities. Yet the percentage of MPAs that might be considered "successful" or effective on ecological and/or socio-economic accounts is debatable. Measurement of biophysical and socio-economic outcome indicators has become de rigeur for examining MPA management effectiveness so that adaptive feedback loops can stimulate new management actions. Scholars and practitioners alike have suggested that more attention should be given to the inputs that are likely to lead to successful MPA outcomes. This paper briefly discusses the potential ecological and socio-economic outcomes of MPAs then reviews the literature on three categories of inputs - governance, management, and local development - that lead to effective MPAs. In conclusion, the paper presents a novel inputs framework that incorporates indicators for governance, management and development to be used in the design and analysis of MPAs. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Protected areas are one of the most widely adopted approaches to conservation, and assessment of their management effectiveness has become a widespread way of evaluating their performance. However, few studies examine how well qualitative management effectiveness assessments predict conservation outcomes. We explored this question in a savanna ecosystem under high conversion pressure: the Brazilian Cerrado. We used data on avoided conversion from 2002 to 2009 in 26 protected areas, derived from comparisons of protected and unprotected sites matched for potential covariates of conversion. We tested for correlation between avoided conversion and management effectiveness scores based on RAPPAM (Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management) and found no evidence that the scores predict avoided conversion. We discuss plausible explanations including an insufficient evidence-base for management evaluation, the largely subjective nature of the assessment method and a limited emphasis on tracking results and effects of management actions. Further research of this nature can help the interpretation of management effectiveness scores and improve the assessment of protected areas performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In Thailand, Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) has been carried out since 1992, through Environmental Protected Areas (EPAs) that are used in coastal planning and management for most popular tourist coasts and islands. This paper examines the effectiveness of Phetchaburi (PB) and Prachuap Kirikhan (PK) EPAs. The study finds the processes and results are not as comprehensive and sustainable as wished. Considerable environmental degradation, i.e., coastal erosion, poor water quality and degraded natural resources were found widely along the EPAs' coasts. The implications of PB and PK EPAs within an ICM framework were analyzed. The study findings indicated the important issues to be resolved include: inefficient intersectoral and intergovernmental integration within and between the multi-governments, weak commitments to financial and human resources, weak leadership and law enforcement capability and limited participatory and adaptive management through the stages of the ICM cycle. Moving forward requires specific actions, commitment, strong leadership and effective cooperation of key stakeholders. Continued building of environmental awareness on the impacts of environmental degradation to people and the economy is also needed. This ambitious project differs from most others in its coverage and the large number of communities and governance bodies that need to reach agreement. We suggest a number of recommendations that apply generally to developing countries wishing to conserve biological diversity and use resources sustainably on coasts with multi-stakeholders and uses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

funding_text 1={ICM was an obvious framework on which to base sound management. Of particular consideration were: close integration within and between governances, long-term commitment of resources, an adequate legislative framework and the capacity to enforce the law. Participatory management must be linked through the ICM cycle to regular monitoring, evaluation and reporting. To resolve the lack of funding, the National Environmental Fund mechanism (under the responsibility of ONEP) is being considered. Through this mechanism the PEO can request special funding from the NEF to support appropriate EPA activities. To achieve this ideal management strategy it is necessary to have a strong leader whose sole aim is to solve problems from inception to outcome. This “problem specific manager” gains input from stakeholders and sells the plan to the broader community always implementing conservation of coastal resources and their sustainable use ( Kirkman and Kirkman, 2002 ).},

abstract={Protected areas are recognised as crucial for conserving biodiversity and supporting the ecological processes that benefit humans, as well as providing recreational and wellbeing benefits. The complexities and uncertainties associated with their management make adaptive management an appealing ideal. This paper examines how two well-developed management methodologies - visitor planning frameworks (e.g. limits of acceptable change) and management effectiveness assessments - contribute to the adaptive management of visitor use of protected areas. A set of principles was developed from the literature by the authors and used to analyse the performance of these methodologies in facilitating adaptive management of visitor use in such areas in Australia. The analysis revealed both methodologies as contributing to institutionalising monitoring and the development of shared understandings. Effectiveness assessments are facilitating adaptation, with systematic evaluation and feedback of results into management evident. Performance of the visitor frameworks was impeded by a lack of commitment to implementation. Identifying and evaluating future options was a weakness of both frameworks. In sum, however, both provide practical, much-needed means for progressing the institutionalisation of adaptive management and hence contributing to innovative solutions to the complex problems facing protected areas. © 2013 Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand Inc.},

abstract={The management effectiveness of protected areas is linked to the type and form of administration structures applied in each country within the framework of its environmental policy implementation. The administration structure gives citizens the opportunity to take part in decision-making processes concerning the environment and includes partnerships with regional authorities, management bodies, competent ministries, academic institutions and non-governmental organizations. The main principles pertaining to the administration of protected areas are based on international conventions aimed at protecting biodiversity and the natural environment. The present study was conducted at Dadia National Park (NP), in the Evros Prefecture. The stakeholders involved in the administration and management of the NP, namely the park management, the municipality of Soufli and the regional authorities of Evros Prefecture, as well as locals and visitors, were asked their opinion about the effectiveness of administration and management of the park. The results of the study indicate that there are weaknesses affecting the collaboration of the administrative bodies, the locals are not satisfied with the local authorities' operations, and the visitors are not being adequately informed about the relevant bodies and type of administration and management of the NP. © of all pictures: Veronika Andrea.},

abstract={Protected areas are favoured sites for ecological research and monitoring and responsible, well-managed research can help to improve management effectiveness and enhance conservation outcomes. Many countries have formalized processes for approving and monitoring research within their protected area systems. There are already a number of codes addressing ethical and social issues with respect to research in protected areas, sacred natural sites and in the traditional territories of indigenous peoples and local communities. However, less attention has been paid at a global scale to the ecological impacts of and access to information from ecological research within protected areas. There are numerous examples of research that is of little value to management or is poorly planned, where the results are not shared with the protected area, and even where research causes significant ecological (and / or social) damage. This paper contains a draft code of practice for those carrying out research in protected areas, which we believe should provide a basis for discussions on minimum standards for academic and other researchers in the future. © 2013, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={The assessment of protected area management effectiveness was developed out of a genuine desire to improve the way protected areas are managed and reported on, in relation to a formalised set of conservation objectives. For monitoring and reporting purposes, a number of participatory methods of rapidly assessing management effectiveness were developed. Most rapid assessment methods rely on scoring a range of protected area-related activities against an objective set of criteria documented in a formal questionnaire. This study evaluated the results of two applications of the same management effectiveness assessment tool applied to the same protected area, namely the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa. The manner in which the assessments were undertaken differed considerably and, not unexpectedly, so did the results, with the national assessment scoring significantly higher than the provincial assessment. Therefore, a further aim was to evaluate the operating conditions applied to each assessment, with a view to determining which assessment was more closely aligned with best practice and hence which score was more credible. The application of the tool differed mainly with respect to the level of spatial detail entered into for the evaluation, the depth and breadth of the management hierarchy that was consulted, the time in which the assessment was undertaken and the degree of peer review applied. Disparate scores such as those obtained in the assessments documented here are likely to bring the discipline of management effectiveness assessment into disrepute unless an acceptable and standardised set of operating procedures is developed and adopted. Recommendations for such a set of 'indispensable constants' were made in this article to ensure that management effectiveness assessments remain robust and reputable, thereby ensuring an honest picture of what is happening on the ground. Conservation implications: We proposed that standard operating procedures should be in place when protected area management effectiveness assessments are undertaken, in order for the results to be credible. This involves ensuring that the right people participate and that each participant is allowed sufficient time to peer review each other. © 2013. The Authors.},

abstract={The ultimate measure of the success or failure of conservation initiatives in an area will be the ecological health of that area and the sustainability of institutions which support that ecological health. Heretofore, no comprehensive data has been presented about the current conservation state of the area known as the Heart of Borneo (HoB), a mostly intact subset of the island of Borneo, which is an international conservation priority. This paper identifies a set of indicators representative of the biodiversity status of the HoB; collecting and analysing data concerning these indicators and combining these data with supplemental conservation information should provide an accurate assessment of the overall conservation state of the HoB. Based on the indicators identified in this study, the general biodiversity status of the HoB is rated as good, or viable, although there are specific elements of concern. Using the threat indicators identified in this study, the overall threat level is medium. Major threats from industrial forest conversion and mining currently exist mainly on the edges of the HoB, but are likely to expand further inland without any intervention simply based on proximity. Though most habitats within (but not outside) the HoB are generally intact, the current protected area system is insufficiently representative of the natural ecosystems of the HoB area and its management effectiveness is as yet unknown. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2013.},

The evaluation was a participatory process that involved several institutions: academe, an externally-funded project, local governments, national government agencies and research organizations. Twenty-three indicators were used for evaluation: six biophysical indicators that largely measured the status of capture fisheries and coastal habitats; eight socioeconomic indicators that largely assessed the economic status and the perceptions of coastal communities; and nine governance indicators that measured the various facets of MPA management. Key lessons learned indicate the need to correlate the perceptions of coastal stakeholders with scientific findings as some perceptions did not reflect the results of biophysical surveys. We illustrate that a multidisciplinary approach and engagement of key stakeholders provides a comprehensive assessment and consensus for measuring the success of MPAs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The requirement to assess the management effectiveness (ME) in protected areas (PAs) is increasing around the world to help improve management and accountability. An evaluation of ME for Khojir National Park (KNP), one of the Iran's oldest PAs, was conducted using a multi-method approach that consisted of structured interviews, open interviews, and site visits. This was the first ME evaluation in Iran. The structured interview was based on the management effectiveness tracking tool methodology. KNP received an average score of 43 %, which is lower than the global average, illustrating that its general management was in the low-intermediate level. The indices of legal status, resource inventory, planning for land and water use, regulations, and objectives received the highest average scores, whereas education and awareness, community co-management, regular work plan, boundary demarcation, visitor facilities, budget sources, staff training, protection systems, and management plan received the lowest ones. The management system of KNP was generally established, but many problems of the management still need to be resolved. To improve ME, some countermeasures should be taken, such as increasing funding, strengthening capacity building, planning, and adaptive management, and implementing community participation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The management effectiveness of protected areas is a critically important consideration for their conservation success. Over 40 different protected area management effectiveness (PAME) data collection tools have been developed to systematically assess protected area management effectiveness. Many of these assessments have recently been collated into the Global IUCN Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME) database. We use the PAME database together with and the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) to assess current progress towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) 2010 and 2015 targets for PAME, which call for at least 30 per cent and 60 per cent of the total area of protected areas to have been assessed in terms of management effectiveness, respectively. We show that globally 29 per cent of the area protected has been assessed and 23 per cent of countries have reached the 60 per cent target. In addition 46 per cent of countries have reached the 30 per cent target. However, analytical results show that there are biases in the type of protected area assessed; protected areas with larger areas, and protected areas designated as National Parks (IUCN category II) are much more likely to have conducted a PAME assessment. In addition there is a paucity of PAME assessments from Europe and North America, where assessments of protected area management may already be integrated into protected area planning and monitoring systems, creating a challenge for reporting to the CBD. We further discuss the potential and limitations of PAME assessments as tools for tracking and evaluating protected area management, and the need for further assessment tools to address the ‘equity’ elements of Target 11 of the CBD. © 2013, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={The Digya National Park in Ghana has been the scene of conflicts between local communities and wildlife managers ever since its establishment in 1971. The conflicts range from apprehension of local people by Wildlife Officials for entry into the park to collect non-timber forest products, to serious confrontation with poachers, arrests and evictions that occasionally result in deaths. Documented information on these conflicts, however, is scanty. This study examines the root causes of conflict in Digya National Park, with a view to recommending policy interventions that will help curtail the conflicts. Data for the study were derived from focused group discussions, direct interviews with stakeholders, on-site observations, as well as, from a management effectiveness evaluation exercise that involved administration of a pre-designed questionnaire to protected area managers and administrators. The results revealed that a major underlying source of conflict in the park was poverty in neighbouring communities. This, together with unresolved issues of compensation payment, animal raids on farmlands and exclusion of local communities in the management process, have fuelled illegal activities, mainly hunting and encroachment, leading to several conflict situations. Arrest of culprits and forced evictions by Wildlife Officials had not helped in curtailing illegal activities and conflicts. The study recommends linking wildlife management to community development to ensure that local economies and livelihoods of fringe communities are sustained while seeking to attain the objectives of wildlife conservation in order to minimize conflicts. © 2013, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={An assessment was undertaken of the governance and related management effectiveness of four protected areas of the Kanchenjunga landscape shared by Bhutan, India and Nepal, using a simple site level tracking tool. The study was further supported by focus group discussion, a survey of key informants and site visits. The management assessment revealed that protected areas are consistently weak in inputs such as number of staff, equipment, financial provision and infrastructure. The results indicate that management improvements are needed. Khangchendzonga biosphere reserve and Singhalila National Park in India scored 41.98 per cent and 32.44 per cent respectively. Slightly higher, Kanchenjunga Conservation Area of Nepal and Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve of Bhutan scored 67.59 per cent and 58.02 per cent respectively. Weak institutional capacity, depredation by wildlife, livestock grazing and illegal harvesting of resources were identified as threats. Limited participation of local people in decision making and protected area management were seen as major challenges. The findings support the recommendation that efforts should be made to move from a protectionist approach to a community-based conservation approach for conservation and sustainable use of biological resources in the landscape. © 2013, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={Management-effectiveness scores are used widely by donors and implementers of conservation projects to prioritize, track, and evaluate investments in protected areas. However, there is little evidence that these scores actually reflect the capacity of protected areas to deliver conservation outcomes. We examined the relation between indicators of management effectiveness in protected areas and the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing fire occurrence in the Amazon rainforest. We used data collected with the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) scorecard, adopted by some of the world's largest conservation organizations to track management characteristics believed to be crucial for protected-area effectiveness. We used the occurrence of forest fires from 2000 through 2010 as a measure of the effect of protected areas on undesired land-cover change in the Amazon basin. We used matching to compare the estimated effect of protected areas with low versus high METT scores on fire occurrence. We also estimated effects of individual protected areas on fire occurrence and explored the relation between these effects and METT scores. The relations between METT scores and effects of protected areas on fire occurrence were weak. Protected areas with higher METT scores in 2005 did not seem to have performed better than protected areas with lower METT scores at reducing fire occurrence over the last 10 years. Further research into the relations between management-effectiveness indicators and conservation outcomes in protected areas seems necessary, and our results show that the careful application of matching methods can be a suitable method for that purpose. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Adaptive management of natural resources is an iterative process of decision making whereby management strategies are progressively changed or adjusted in response to new information. Despite an increasing focus on the need for adaptive conservation strategies, there remain few applied examples. We describe the 9-year process of adaptive comanagement of a marine protected area network in Kubulau District, Fiji. In 2011, a review of protected area boundaries and management rules was motivated by the need to enhance management effectiveness and the desire to improve resilience to climate change. Through a series of consultations, with the Wildlife Conservation Society providing scientific input to community decision making, the network of marine protected areas was reconfigured so as to maximize resilience and compliance. Factors identified as contributing to this outcome include well-defined resource-access rights; community respect for a flexible system of customary governance; long-term commitment and presence of comanagement partners; supportive policy environment for comanagement; synthesis of traditional management approaches with systematic monitoring; and district-wide coordination, which provided a broader spatial context for adaptive-management decision making. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={Marine ecological capital is defined as marine ecological resources which are able to have direct or indirect positive influences in human' s social and economic production and provide benefits for human. Marine ecological capital value consists of the existing value of marine ecological resources, as well as the marine ecosystem service value. The assessment of marine ecological capital includes marine ecological resources and marine ecosystem services. Marine ecosystem services consist of four groups of services (i.e. provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services) and 16 subgroups of services. Provisioning services consist of maricultral production, fishing production, oxygen production, raw material production, and genetic resources supply; Regulating services consist of climate regulation, waste treatment, biological control, and disturbance regulation; Cultural services consist of recreational service, cultural usage, and scientific service; Supporting services consist of primary production, nutrients cycling, species diversity maintenance, and ecosystem diversity maintenance. Considering the utilization patterns of ecosystem services in China coastal waters, this paper developed the assessment methods of marine ecosystem services in both mass and monetary under the marine ecological capital frameworks. We selected 9 services among the above 16 services to be valued and summed up as the total value of ecosystem services. Moreover for each service, its evaluation methods, calculation formulas, parameters and data resources are given too. Maricultural, fishing, and oxygen productions are selected to assess provisioning services. Climate regulation and waste treatment are selected to assess regulating services. Recreational and scientific services are chosen to assess cultural services. Species and ecosystem diversity maintenances are chosen to assess supporting services. The market-price method is recommended to valuate maricultural and fishing productions. The replaced-cost method is recommended to valuate oxygen production, waste treatment, and scientific service. The replaced-market-price method is recommended to valuate climate regulation. The travel-cost method and replaced-income method are recommended to valuate recreational service. The contingent-value method is recommended to valuate species and ecosystem diversity maintenances. Currently, the services including raw material, cultural usage, biological control, and disturbance regulation services from marine ecosystems were excluded from the calculation monetary value of marine ecosystem services, because it is difficult to access the statistical data for assessment; also it is unclear to how to valuate cultural usage and genetic resources supply provided from marine ecosystem. Primary production provides energy and carbon, while nutrients cycling provide nitrogen, phosphorous and silicate, to support the smooth run of marine ecosystem. However human being does not directly or indirectly use primary production, nutrients cycling from sea. Moreover the benefits human get from these two services have been calculated during calculating the other services (i.e. maricultural, fishing and raw material production, waste treatment). Therefore, primary production and nutrients cycling should not be evaluated in monetary term, but they may be evaluated in mass term. This set of assessment methods of marine ecosystem services has been applied to evaluate the ecosystem services of Shandong provincial coastal waters located in Yellow Sea and of Dongshan and Luoyuan bays located in East China Sea. These assessment methods have been adopted by China' s "Technical Directives for Marine Ecological Capital Assessment" after passing review of several expert committees. This set of methods provide an applicable technical tool to enforce the policies for ecological capital accounting, compensation against ecological damage accidents, payment for ecosystem services of marine protected areas, and marine and fisheries management effectiveness assessment.},

abstract={Responsibility for the management of many protected areas in the Northern Territory, Australia, is shared between the management agency and the aboriginal owners of that land. We describe (1) the creation and types of indicators developed by partners in a participatory process to measure management effectiveness, (2) the assessment method used to monitor progress, and (3) the results of the first cycle of evaluations in four jointly managed parks. Although each pilot park area has distinctive features, we were able to identify a set of twelve common indicators that were applied across the four park areas. The agreed indicators, which were scored using a color scale to indicate level of achievement, were primarily concerned with process rather than outcome, with particular emphasis on the strength of social relationships. Thus, there were indicators that assessed performance in governance and decision making, application and interpretation of cultural heritage and traditional ecological knowledge, expansion of social capital, human and financial resources, and visitors, with little emphasis on the biophysical outcomes of the management. The emphasis on the quality of the process of joint management was thought to indicate that the relationship between the joint management partners was relatively new, with trust only starting to develop. We discuss opportunities and difficulties for replication and adaptation of indicators to all jointly managed parks in the Northern Territory. © 2013 by the author(s).},

abstract={Calls for management effectiveness of protected areas have been made on the grounds that evaluation can help determine the ability of protected areas to meet their goals, identify opportunities and threats, and encourage stakeholders to adapt to changing conditions. In 1995, the Statutory Framework of the World Network of biosphere reserves included a requirement that all biosphere reserves must undergo a process of periodic review once every 10 years. The primary purpose of the periodic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of biosphere reserve organizations in achieving the objectives related to three functions: biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and logistical support. Beyond meeting statutory requirements, the periodic review process can also be considered an opportunity for learning within and beyond the national and international networks. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how management effectiveness in Canadian biosphere reserves has been interpreted through the periodic review process conducted in Canada. A content analysis was performed on the 15 periodic review reports of the 11 Canadian biosphere reserves reviewed between 1995 and 2012. Determining compliance appears to be the dominant purpose of periodic reviews, while determining and providing learning opportunities through periodic review is emerging. We conclude that periodic reviews can be used as learning tools if systematic efforts are made to evaluate, reflect, and share lessons learned. Specific recommendations are provided to enhance this possibility. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The Canadian Commission for UNESCO, which functions as an arm's length agency under the general authority of the Canada Council for the Arts, offers some limited secretariat services to the Canada-MAB committee. Funds to support a part-time federal government employee to act as a liaison between government and biosphere reserves were cut when that employee retired in 2010. One biosphere reserve (Clayoquot Sound) receives funding from a trust fund established by the federal government when it was created. One biosphere reserve (Redberry Lake) received funding from the provincial government for five years. Other biosphere reserves receive funding through a variety of strategies including memberships, parking fees, project grants, fees-for-service agreements and consultancies.},

abstract={Aim: The world's network of protected areas (PAs) plays a critical role in biodiversity conservation. The management expertise within PAs is a function of the training, support and depth of the staff tasked with protecting the resources and should be a significant factor determining the distribution of wildlife species. However, there are few measurable linkages between wildlife populations and management effectiveness. Here, we addressed whether the management expertise within a PA is an important covariate explaining the occupancy of large terrestrial mammals, and identify the attributes of mammal species that would be effective for comparative monitoring of management effectiveness within PAs of developing countries. Location: Six PAs within giant panda region, south-west China. Methods: We used systematic camera-trapping as the primary field methodology to detect the presence of large mammals and used expert scoring to assess the management level of these PAs. Occupancy modelling and logistic regression were used to determine those mammal species with adequate detections to control for ecological covariates and to compare differences in management level between the sampled PAs. Results: Thirty-eight mammal species were recorded with a total sampling effort of 16,521 camera-days at 722 sample sites. Among the 14 examined mammals, Takin (Budorcas taxicolor) was the most detected mammal (333 detections at 153 locations), whereas Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) was estimated with the highest occupancy rate (ψ = 0.49) and leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was estimated with the highest detection probability (P = 0.55). The independently assessed estimate of management expertise was a significant positive predictor for the occupancy of 11 of the 14 mammal species. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that there are measurable consequences for increasing PA patrolling and that standardized monitoring of large mammals is an adequate comparative measure of management effectiveness across diverse PAs that experience extensive poaching pressure. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Protected areas' overall goal is to achieve the long-term conservation of natural and associated cultural goods and services. However, effective long-term conservation of natural and associated cultural resources cannot always be guaranteed by a protection regime or even by effective management, as it is usually assumed. The ultimate goal of assessing protected areas is therefore concerned less with management effectiveness than with their overall long-term effectiveness. This paper describes the methodology underpinning the System for the Integrated Assessment of Protected Areas (SIAPA). The aim of SIAPA is to make the concept of 'effectiveness' operational when applied to protected areas. It is an innovative, horizontal site-level assessment system for evaluating integrally and comparably the effectiveness of terrestrial protected areas, as the assessment is based on the same parameters. Indicators are the basic assessment units. They were weighted by an expert panel and integrated into six categories (indexes) defining the effectiveness of protected areas: state of conservation, planning, management, social and economic context, social perception and valuation, and threats to conservation. These indexes were subsequently integrated into a single super-index: an effectiveness index for the protected area. Two alternative models of the SIAPA were developed: the complete model, containing 43 indicators, in order to maximize the amount of information on each protected area; and the simplified model, containing 28 indicators, in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the assessment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Quantifying progress in management of marine protected areas (MPAs) is crucial to marine conservation and fisheries management in the Philippines. This study compiles data on the status, occurrence, and management gaps of MPAs through coordination with multiple organizations supporting and guiding MPAs in the Philippines. MPA management effectiveness was measured using a MPA Rating System. Since 2002 the modal MPA rating levels increased from level 1 (initiated) to level 4 (sustained) in 2008/9. This upward trend is attributed to factors that promoted both the establishment and improved management of MPAs. Analysis indicated that: (1) most MPAs struggle with budgetary constraints or lack of sustainable financing and (2) overall the MPAs are being maintained and progressing with notable improvement in management despite a range of difficulties encountered during the implementation process. For MPAs in the Visayan Region for which biophysical data were available, the MPA Rating System was used to assess the effectiveness of local government capacity building on MPA coral reef health. Our results suggest that MPAs with higher ratings are likely to have better reef health conditions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Increasing land consumption and loss of biodiversity make it particularly important that protected areas fulfil their function. This, however, is often impaired by insufficient political and financial support. This study investigates how existing protected area management capacities can be used more effectively in a prompt and lasting manner. Therefore, data from protected area management effectiveness evaluations were analysed. Efficient workflows and teamwork were identified to be key capacities for effective management. Simultaneously, deficient financial and social security, lack of incentives and inflexible management structures prevent the productive use of existing capacities. In order to improve the situation, greater attention should be given to intangible assets. Additionally, protected area managers and employees must be enabled to be more self-reliant and self-responsible in order to foster a lasting learning process. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This study adopts and modifies the WWF Rapid assessment and prioritization of protected areas management methodology (RAPPAM) to evaluate the management effectiveness of five protected areas in Taiwan. The results indicate that, unlike the situation in most developing countries, the threats and pressures faced by protected areas in Taiwan come mainly from the outside-with pollution as the most common pressure and threat, and difficult for their management authorities to deal with effectively. The categories and extent of these pressures and threats are related to remoteness and geographic location of the protected areas. All five cases under study reveal a similar management approach, clear management goals, adequate basic infrastructure and clear management decision-making; on the down side, however, all of them suffer from the lack of an effective comprehensive management plan, inadequate or poor quality human resources and insufficient funding. The present study suggests that first priority should be given to strengthening management planning in order to improve management effectiveness of protected areas in Taiwan. The adjustment made to RAPPAM in this study was to amend and take the format of the management plan as the basis for evaluation material preparations and open the discussion to encourage stakeholders' participation to open the dialogue among them. The results indicate that, although the system evaluation design still has some constraints, the quality of information collected is improved and can respond more directly to the specific demands of the respective areas. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={Created in Europe and expanded to world subsequently, the Geoparks have an important role in the geological heritage conservation strategies, mainly through the Geosciences disclosure and teaching. Their aims permit the natural heritage conservation become compatible, especially the geological, and cultural of its land, at the same time it encourages the local sustainable development. The entry of a Geopark in the Global Geoparks Network - GGN does not ensure its perpetuity, because they are evaluated each 4 years, under the penalty of losing UNESCO seal, in case they do not accomplish the imposed requirements. Therefore, Geoparks effective management will permit the execution of its aims, and consequently, its stableness in GGN. Brazil has one Geopark, the Geopark Araripe, it was created in 2006, and it is located in the southern most Ceará State. This paper aims: analyze Geopark Araripe management effectiveness; test the management effectiveness adaptation methodology in Geopark Araripe; evaluate in what ambit it is more effective and in what it is less effective; compare its management effectiveness level with other protected areas; and propose actions to increase its effectiveness. After analyze 45 variables, the analysis of Geopark Araripe handling effectiveness resulted in a 60,9% of its excellent total, being classified as a medium satisfactory. Therefore, this paper concludes, althought the identification of some weakness to be adjusted, the management of Geopark Araripe, shows positive points, having potential maintenance of its goals in a medium and long terms, especially, the improvement of its status for effective.},

abstract={Great strides have been made in identifying and measuring the conditions that favor the success of marine protected areas (MPAs). We can also evaluate the management effectiveness of MPAs. More attention is being paid to sustainable financing, and MPA networks help us to scale-up their benefits. Yet, the capacity to manage or co-manage MPAs often remains limited, especially in small island developing states, even after numerous capacity assessment and development initiatives. Capacity is more than a collection of human technical skills supplemented by physical and financial assets. It is a complex multi-dimensional concept that also includes less easily measurable overarching components such as worldview, organizational culture, and propensity for networking that tend to shape the more mechanistic elements of capacity. We offer a largely qualitative analysis of practical observations on how capacity and management effectiveness (in terms of biophysical, socioeconomic, and governance aspects) have combined to influence success and lack of success in a selection of small Caribbean MPAs. Lessons learned from this analysis contribute to our understanding of the role that human dimensions play in MPA success. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The Convention on Biological Diversity Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 was adopted at the 10th Conference of the Parties in Nagoya, Japan. The plan outlines 20 Aichi Targets to achieve global biodiversity conservation. A fundamental global approach to biodiversity conservation is the use of protected areas. Arguably all 20 Aichi Targets have implications for the establishment and management of protected areas, but only Target 11 addresses them directly. This paper carries out a clause by clause analysis of Target 11 and makes recommendations to countries on interpreting each clause in order to best achieve biodiversity conservation using protected areas. Despite containing only 61 words, Target 11 is surprisingly dense. It applies to both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and sets goals for spatial planning (representiveness, ecological connectivity and areas of importance for biodiversity); protected areas management (including management effectiveness and social equity); and criteria about what counts toward being a protected area under Target 11. We argue for a holistic interpretation of Target 11 as a way for the global community to use protected areas to change the current unacceptable trends in global biodiversity loss. © 2012, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

abstract={In order to ensure effectiveness of marine protected area (MPA) management, the development of relevant indicators and evaluation of marine protected areas' performance is increasingly advocated. While most studies so far have focused on MPAs in tropical areas, this study investigates performance of temperate MPAs in British Columbia on the West coast of Canada. Contextual factors including management goals, conservation values and impacts on provincially managed MPAs are assessed. In addition, management issues and necessary improvements for increasing current management effectiveness are analysed for multiple MPAs and potential performance indicators identified. Results indicate that MPA management in British Columbia needs to be improved in all stages of the management cycle including the design of MPAs. Further obvious is a great need for intergovernmental collaboration and inclusion of aboriginal groups, besides the integration of marine user groups. By comparing available information on a range of MPAs, the study also finds that most identified performance indicators appear to be site-specific. Only a few indicators, mainly governance ones, were identified for multiple MPAs and thus seem to be indicative for the performance of MPA management on a wider scale. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={All European States have signed the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and have thus committed to evaluate the management effectiveness of protected areas. The majority of European states have already examined management effectiveness in some protected areas. However, few states have reached the agreed goal to evaluate 30 % of their terrestrial protected areas by 2010. Evaluation methodologies, management agency and protected area management categories vary largely across Europe. While international evaluation tools are mainly used by donors, certifiers and researchers several countries have developed individual methodologies, often initiated by the national management agency. The evaluation of management effectiveness needs to become part of the protected area management cycle. An overall goal should be the regular and cost-effective implementation of assessments, for instance by combining different evaluation and reporting obligations. In addition, data quality and transparence of evaluations in European protected areas needs to be enhanced. Therefore, it is necessary that these evaluations are seen as learning process, not as judgment.},

abstract={Despite expected benefits such as conservation, recreation or sustainable development, most protected areas (PAs) have serious problems in implementing basic management functions such as planning, organizing, coordination or control. In order to maximize management effectiveness, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has developed the rapid assessment and prioritization of protected area management (RAPPAM) methodology for assessment of protected area management at system level based on planning, pressure and threats, inputs, processes and outputs. The RAPPAM assessment was implemented in the Turkish part of the West Lesser Caucasus for 11 PAs with 3 different categories. Two meetings were conducted with the participation of 70 people in possession of the best local knowledge about the PAs in the region. The results show that management assessment scores in all areas were rather low and this finding was similar throughout Turkey. In general, policy environment scores were remarkably below the average, showing that the importance and priority of conservation among public policies is rather low. Threats in the region were high in areas with high biological diversity. Further, semi natural processes, pollution, conversion and tourism appeared to be the greatest threat and pressure elements for the PAs in the region. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

abstract={Management effectiveness evaluations are an increasingly common approach to measuring conservation outcomes within protected areas. While these evaluations have the potential to provide valuable data to guide management, the accuracy of evaluation data is not reported. We investigated how evaluation data are collected and used, the criticisms made of evaluation methods, and the processes employed to address criticisms or ensure accuracy. We found that most evaluation tools use qualitative indicators of management success and rely heavily on the knowledge of protected area managers. Criticisms of the evaluation methods have led to improvements to the data collection process, but the precision and accuracy of these data are almost never measured. We believe that measuring the accuracy of evaluation data will provide important opportunities to improve the rigor of future evaluations and build confidence in the use of these data for adapting protected area management. ©2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The management implications of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) cover the interactions and two-way effects between the ecosystem and local residents. Hence, support or resistance from stakeholders is critical to management effectiveness. The inclusion of the perspectives of stakeholders into the MPAs of sustainable utilization can reduce opposition and conflict, improving the effectiveness of MPA management through the input of local residents. This study used interviews, questionnaire surveys, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process to obtain the opinions of different groups regarding the choices and preferences of stakeholders in the assessed factors of the sustainable utilization of MPAs in Green Island, Taiwan. The results showed that the stakeholder groups have a consensus on the " completeness of ecosystems," " processing of wastes and pollutants," and " integrated management." These results provide insight into the varying perspectives held by individual groups, accelerating the integration of different opinions in order to facilitate appropriate solutions and smooth negotiations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Marine protected areas (MPAs) and MPA networks are valuable tools for protecting coral reef habitats and managing near-shore fisheries, while playing an essential role in the overall conservation of marine biodiversity. In addition, MPAs and their networks are often the core strategy for larger scale and more integrated forms of marine resource management that can lead to ecosystem-based management regimes for seascapes and eco-regions. This study conducted in 2008 documents the status of selected MPAs and MPA networks in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea, to better understand development and their level of success in the Coral Triangle. Findings reveal that substantial gaps exist between the theory and practice of creating functional MPA networks. Across these sites, biophysical and social science knowledge, required to build functional and effective MPAs or MPA networks, lagged behind substantially. Aspects that appeared to require the most attention to improve MPA network effectiveness included essential management systems, institutional arrangements, governance and sustainable financing. Common indicators of success such as increased fish catch and habitat quality parameters were consistently associated with several independent variables: sustainable financing for management, clarity of MPA network rules, enforcement by community level enforcers, local skills development, and involvement in management by local elected politicians, a functional management board, multi-stakeholder planning mechanisms and participatory biophysical assessments. Conclusions are that although considerable investments have been made in MPAs and potential MPA networks in the Coral Triangle, management effectiveness is generally poor throughout the region and that not many large, formally declared MPAs are well managed.

abstract={We report on land management and protected area management effectiveness in the tiger range. Wild tigers Panthera tigris are found in 13 countries, with habitat that is also important for ecosystem services, biodiversity and a number of other threatened species. Timber production, mineral mining, oil and gas concessions and protected areas are common land-use designations in tiger habitat. Twenty-one per cent of the current tiger range is under some form of protection, while 9% is designated as 'strictly protected,' in IUCN categories I or II. Fifteen per cent of the tiger range is under oil and gas concession. These concessions also overlap 152 protected areas, 55 of which are categorized as strictly protected. Management effectiveness tracking tool responses suggest that the majority of protected areas in the tiger range are inadequately managed to meet their objectives, and the most commonly reported management challenges are minimal enforcement and budgets. We observe that even strictly protected areas are subject to a variety of pressures, particularly resource extraction. Results imply that the establishment and enforcement of effective protected areas in each tiger landscape, sufficient to protect and grow breeding tiger populations, could help change current trends. These areas should be free from incompatible land uses, and should be adequately resourced to meet management, enforcement and monitoring challenges. Weaknesses in protected area management identified here have implications for species and ecosystem services that share the same geography as tigers. In addition, results suggest that similar issues may exist for threatened species and protected areas in other geographies as well. © 2011 World Wildlife Fund, Inc. © 2011 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={Though protected areas have grown considerably over the last 130 years, there are several troubling trends, including national and regional disparities, ecological gaps, a decline in the growth of new protected areas, and problems with ineffective management. At the same time, society increasingly expects protected areas to provide an expanded array of benefits, including climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation. This poses three main questions for policy makers. The first question is where new protected areas should be located in order to maximise climate change resilience, adaptation and mitigation. Planners can incorporate climate change into ecological gap assessments (e.g. by incorporating climate-related data and carbon sequestration into their algorithms), as well as consider basic climate-related design features in the layout of new protected areas. The second question is how protected areas should be managed to maximise climate change resilience, mitigation and adaptation. Planners can explicitly include climate-related issues in their management plans, management effectiveness assessments, threat assessments, monitoring, research and capacity-building programs. The third is what factors and policies are necessary to enable protected areas to maximise climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation. Planners can better integrate protected area planning into sectoral planning such as transportation, energy and invasive species; assess and communicate the full economic value of protected areas in addressing climate-related issues such as national food and water security; and ensure that protected areas are an integral part of climate adaptation planning. Although there are potential tradeoffs between managing protected areas for biodiversity and for climate, the overwhelming societal, economic and ecological benefits of protected areas make them a natural and cost-effective investment. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper examines key factors used in protecting the migratory North Atlantic right whale within the context of a marine protected area (MPA) system, using the Grand Manan Whale Conservation Area, in New Brunswick Canada, as a case study example. Designated as a conservation area in 1993, before the Oceans Act came into effect, the Grand Manan conservation area currently does not form part of the Canadian network of MPAs. Given the possibility that MPA designation may occur, the paper examines factors that should be considered in meeting International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) MPA design criteria and IUCN evaluation model requirements. An MPA evaluation framework based on an IUCN evaluation model (Hockings et al., 2000 [1]) is designed to assess the effectiveness of an MPA in protecting a migratory right whale. Case study results indicate that current management and research activities for the Grand Manan conservation area address most governance, biophysical and socio-economic issues under an IUCN evaluation framework. On a site basis, it is recommended that the Grand Manan conservation area be designated as a component of the Canadian network of MPAs and that regulations be developed and implemented under the Species at Risk Act to clearly define activities considered damaging or destructive to right whale critical habitat. Recommendations also suggest the preparation of a combined site management-action plan for the Grand Manan conservation area indicating how activities specified in North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Strategy will be implemented locally. On a regional and international basis, recommendations call for an internationally coordinated and integrated approach to right whale protection within the context of a network of designated critical habitat areas. Recommended activities include: continued Canadian participation in cross-border research and actions to mitigate threats to the right whales over their migratory range; development of a regional right whale management and monitoring strategy; and designation of additional critical habitats in national/international waters. It is further recommended that the evaluation framework developed by this paper be used as a model in assessing the conservation and management effectiveness of MPAs protecting other migratory marine species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Joint management of protected areas is promoted in many countries around the world. It is considered a means to provide local communities, including indigenous people, with recognition of their cultural practices in the use and management of the natural resources within a protected area, while working together with governments to achieve conservation goals. However, implementation of effective joint management has often been difficult because capacities and expectations among partners differ. Here we explore the potential of using a participatory monitoring and evaluation approach as a means of not only agreeing among partners on the objectives of joint management but also of measuring progress toward those objectives. In particular, we first describe the process used to develop criteria and indicators for measuring joint management effectiveness of a protected area in the Northern Territory, Australia, involving the park's Aboriginal Traditional Owners, their legal representatives, government, and researchers. We then analyze the process of applying a participatory approach to developing indicators and its contribution to improving equity among the partners. We consider the effectiveness of a participatory process within the context of the relationships, capacities, skills, communication, and cross-cultural information sharing. We found that at the early stages of joint management, the partners mostly identify process indicators related to human and social capital assets. Cross-cultural engagement in the early stages of the monitoring and evaluation cycle is challenged by issues relating to communication, institutional and community capacities, representation, and flexibility in ways of working together while learning by doing. We conclude, however, that a participatory monitoring and evaluation approach in which partners agree equally on the identification of criteria and indicators to measure agreed management outcomes has the potential of improving equitable participation, decision making and working relationships, which in turn will lead to improved park management effectiveness and community outcomes. © 2011 by the author(s).},

abstract={We compiled details of over 8000 assessments of protected area management effectiveness across the world and developed a method for analyzing results across diverse assessment methodologies and indicators. Data was compiled and analyzed for over 4000 of these sites. Management of these protected areas varied from weak to effective, with about 40% showing major deficiencies. About 14% of the surveyed areas showed significant deficiencies across many management effectiveness indicators and hence lacked basic requirements to operate effectively. Strongest management factors recorded on average related to establishment of protected areas (legal establishment, design, legislation and boundary marking) and to effectiveness of governance; while the weakest aspects of management included community benefit programs, resourcing (funding reliability and adequacy, staff numbers and facility and equipment maintenance) and management effectiveness evaluation. Estimations of management outcomes, including both environmental values conservation and impact on communities, were positive. We conclude that in spite of inadequate funding and management process, there are indications that protected areas are contributing to biodiversity conservation and community well-being. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Worldwide efforts have concentrated on developing monitoring methods that would enhance the assessment of progress toward achieving the 2010 conservation objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Threat reduction assessment is one such method. It provides an indirect measure of the effects of a conservation project by evaluating changes in human-induced direct threats to protected areas. We applied modified threat reduction assessments and the 2008 International Union for Conservation of Nature standardized lexicon for classification of threats to Horsh Ehden and Al-Shouf Cedar nature reserves in Lebanon. Our goal was in part to test the suitability of this tool for improving monitoring and management effectiveness of protected forests in Lebanon. In Horsh Ehden, composite threats decreased by 24% from 1997 to 2002, and then increased from 2002 to 2009 by 78% in the core area of the reserve and by 118% in the reserve's buffer zone (surrounds core area, conservation and recreational activities allowed). In Al-Shouf Cedar reserve threats decreased by 51% from 2006 to 2009. Management teams from both reserves have integrated the use of this method to prioritize actions for new management plans. We believe that in Lebanon and other countries with limited resources and weak monitoring programs or that are experiencing political instability threat reduction assessments could be used to improve the effectiveness of protected areas management. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={National Heritage Areas (NHAs) are an alternative and increasingly popular form of protected area management in the United States. NHAs seek to integrate environmental objectives with community and economic objectives at regional or landscape scales. NHA designations have increased rapidly in the last 20 years, generating a substantial need for evaluative information about (a) how NHAs work; (b) outcomes associated with the NHA process; and (c) the costs and benefits of investing public moneys into the NHA approach. Qualitative evaluation studies recently conducted at three NHAs have identified the importance of understanding network structure and function in the context of evaluating NHA management effectiveness. This article extends these case studies by examining quantitative network data from each of the sites. The authors analyze these data using both a descriptive approach and a statistically more robust approach known as exponential random graph modeling. Study findings indicate the presence of transitive structures and the absence of three-cycle structures in each of these networks. This suggests that these networks are relatively ''open,'' which may be desirable, given the uncertainty of the environments in which they operate. These findings also suggest, at least at the sites reported here, that the NHA approach may be an effective way to activate and develop networks of intersectoral organizational partners. Finally, this study demonstrates the utility of using quantitative network analysis to better understand the effectiveness of protected area management models that rely on partnership networks to achieve their intended outcomes. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Protected areas (PAs) play an important role in biodiversity conservation and the implementation of ambitious multilateral environmental agreements, like the 2010 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In the CBD's Programme of Work on Protected Areas, it is requested that each country conduct management effectiveness evaluations of at least thirty percent of its PAs by 2010. This article compares the most common methodologies of PA management effectiveness evaluations, such as the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) Methodology, the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) and UNESCO's Enhancing our Heritage (EoH) Toolkit. These and other methodologies can help to (1) examine overall effectiveness of PAs, (2) identify factors influencing the effectiveness and (3) determine common threats and their seriousness.However, the outcomes of major studies concerning overall effectiveness as well as success and failure factors for PA management are partially contradictory. Different results can be due to the approach (e.g. number and type of indicators or assessors included in the evaluation process) or to the individual context of the PA (e.g. age, region, IUCN category) and therefore these factors need to be considered when comparing results of management effectiveness studies.Research indicates that increased attention should be paid to regular monitoring of conservation activities in PAs including systematic social science studies with a socio-economic and socio-cultural focus. Unfortunately, the outcomes of the management effectiveness studies are not easily accessible and have not yet been widely shared or distributed among the conservation community. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.},

abstract={Partnerships between scientists and local communities can increase research capacity and data delivery while improving management effectiveness through enhanced community participation. To encourage such collaboration, this study demonstrates how these partnerships can be formed, drawing on two case studies in coral reef ecosystems in very different social settings (Papua New Guinea and Australia). In each case, steps towards successfully engaging communities in research were similar. These included: (1) early engagement by collaborating organizations to build trust, (2) ensuring scientific questions have direct relevance to the community, (3) providing appropriate incentives for participation, and (4) clear and open communication. Community participants engaged in a variety of research activities, including locating and capturing fishes, collecting and recording data (weight, length and sex), applying external tags, and removing otoliths (ear bones) for ageing and elemental analysis. Research partnerships with communities enhanced research capacity, reduced costs and, perhaps more importantly, improved the likelihood of long-term community support for marine protected areas (MPAs). © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={With the growing recognition of the need to preserve and protect the world's marine resources have come accelerated calls at the international, regional, and national scales for increased numbers of marine protected areas (MPAs). In parallel, there are growing concerns and questions about the management effectiveness of existing MPAs. A first of its kind program in East Africa, the Western Indian Ocean Certification of Marine Protected Area Professionals or the WIO-COMPAS Program, is taking a new approach to addressing this challenge. It ensures individuals responsible for designing, managing, and operating these areas have the right skills sets and competences to help achieve management effectiveness. It then publicly certifies these individuals as having those requisite skills; and creates professional networks through which these individuals moving forward can share experiences, promote the approaches that work, and avoid repeating proven mistakes. This article outlines the global movement to increase MPAs and their effectiveness; the general model for certification of professionals and the rationale for MPA-specific certification; the WIO-COMPAS Program overview from content to management framework; the process used by the creators of the WIO-COMPAS to develop and implement the program in the region; results to date; lessons learned; and recommendations for others interested in replicating the program in other regions of the world. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Governing norms by which to steer traditional government functions are well established and understood; however, this is not the case for the new multi-level and collaborative approaches that characterize protected area governance. This is largely new territory that makes novel demands on governance institutions and policy. In this context, establishing and maintaining good governance across the diversity of ownership and responsibility arrangements is critical for the future effectiveness and acceptability of protected areas. Fulfilling the promise and avoiding the pitfalls inherent in contemporary protected area governance will require an understanding of what is meant by 'good governance' and development of associated mechanisms to assess performance and provide a basis for improvement. This paper's contribution lies in the guidance it provides for the hitherto under-developed area of governance quality assessment. I first present a framework that positions governance quality in relation to governance and management effectiveness. I then characterize good protected area governance according to a set of seven principles - legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, connectivity and resilience. Together, the framework, governance principles and related performance outcomes provide a platform for assessment of governance quality for an individual terrestrial protected area, a network of several protected areas, or a national protected area system. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
