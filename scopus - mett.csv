Management effectiveness assessment is an important component of conservation management in protected areas. In this study, we constructed a management effectiveness assessment tool based on publicly available information for China, with a total score of 126. We used the tool to systematically assess 27 national MPAs in the East China Sea. Our results showed that marine nature reserves (MNRs) and marine special reserves (MSRs) could be classified into two and three classifications, respectively, including MNRs I (n = 4, scores = 88-100), MNRs II (n = 6, scores = 75-81), MSRs I (n = 8, scores = 75-90), MSRs II (n = 6, scores = 59-75) and MSRs III (n = 3, scores = 53-56). Factors influencing the management effectiveness of nature reserves were the length of establishment and general public budget revenue, while for special reserves they were the length of establishment and total agricultural output value. Furthermore, protected areas with high management effectiveness scores tend to have a longer establishment time, dedicated management departments, adequate management staff and financial investment compared to those with low scores. In addition, the low-score MPAs require more communication with stakeholders. The study provides an objective and comprehensive systematic scoring of MPAs’ management using METT-based framework and multi-source data. It overcomes the challenge of the general lack of data on MPAs and provides a new approach to management effectiveness assessment.

At least 473 sites in this region have completed Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) assessments since 2003, often associated with Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded projects, but also through work funded by other donors and WWF itself. We show that community managed reserves score higher using the METT tool when compared with sites managed by the state forest agencies. We situate this within the context of approaches to reserve management in Tanzania, where state-managed Forest Reserves have received little in terms of funding support and score lowest when compared with all other management types in Tanzania. Further, we show that slightly higher average METT scores for sites where WWF are working across Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique, when compared with all other sites, are most pronounced in elements of the METT tool relating to inputs, process and planning, and are not seen in outputs or outcomes.

In the CBD's Programme of Work on Protected Areas, it is requested that each country conduct management effectiveness evaluations of at least thirty percent of its PAs by 2010. This article compares the most common methodologies of PA management effectiveness evaluations, such as the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) Methodology, the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) and UNESCO's Enhancing our Heritage (EoH) Toolkit. These and other methodologies can help to (1) examine overall effectiveness of PAs, (2) identify factors influencing the effectiveness and (3) determine common threats and their seriousness.However, the outcomes of major studies concerning overall effectiveness as well as success and failure factors for PA management are partially contradictory. Different results can be due to the approach (e.g. number and type of indicators or assessors included in the evaluation process) or to the individual context of the PA (e.g. age, region, IUCN category) and therefore these factors need to be considered when comparing results of management effectiveness studies.Research indicates that increased attention should be paid to regular monitoring of conservation activities in PAs including systematic social science studies with a socio-economic and socio-cultural focus. Unfortunately, the outcomes of the management effectiveness studies are not easily accessible and have not yet been widely shared or distributed among the conservation community. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Management effectiveness evaluations; Programme of work of the convention on biological diversity; Protected areas","","","","","","","","Andam K.S., Ferraro P.J., Pfaff A., Sanchez-Azofeifa G.A., Robalino J.A., Measuring the effectiveness of protected area networks in reducing deforestation, PNAS, 105, 42, pp. 16089-16094, (2008); Balmford A., Bennun L., ten Brink B., Cooper D., Cote I.M., Crane P., Dobson A., Dudley N., Dutton I., Green R.E., Gregory R.D., Harrison J., Kennedy E.T., Kremen C., Leader-Williams N., Lovejoy T.E., Mace G., May R., Mayaux P., Morling P., Phillips J., Redford K., Ricketts T.H., Rodriguez J.P., Sanjayan M., Schei P.J., van Jaarsveld A.S., Walther B.A., ECOLOGY: The Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010 target, Science, 307, pp. 212-213, (2005); Bertzky M., Stoll-Kleemann S., Multi-level discrepancies with sharing data on protected areas: What we have and what we need for the global village, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, pp. 8-24, (2009); Bruner A.G., Gullison R.E., Rice R.E., da Fonseca G.A.B., Effectiveness of parks in protecting tropical biodiversity, Science, 291, pp. 125-128, (2001); Chape S., Harrison J., Spalding M., Lysenko I., Measuring the extent and effectiveness of protected areas as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 360, pp. 443-455, (2005); (2006); Cracco M., Calvopina J., Courrau J., Medina M.M., Novo I., Oetting I., Surkin J., Ulloa R., Vasquez P., Fortalecimiento de la efectividad de manejo de áreas protegidas en los Andes.

Protected areas around the world are not achieving the conservation objectives for which they were established, often due to a lack in effective management practices. Hence, protected area management effectiveness and its assessments are crucial elements of achieving responsive and pro-active management. Ramsar Sites that are not recognized as a protected area under the national park and wildlife conservation act in Nepal are often ignored for such assessments and receive little attention in terms of conservation and management. This study aimed to fill this gap by assessing Jagadishpur Reservoir Ramsar Site, which falls into the above category. The Ramsar Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool was used to assess the management effectiveness. Transformed into the global standard reporting format, the overall management effectiveness was 0.27 on a 0 to 1 scale. This score is considered to be in an inadequate range, requiring significant conservation intervention from government with support from conservation partners. This first assessment of Ramsar Site outside of protected area in Nepal and its comparison to global and European regional-level assessments provides the benchmark for future evaluation to track progress in management effectiveness. In conclusion, Ramsar Sites outside formally protected areas are often neglected and intermittent projects, and ad hoc implementation of small-scale activities seems inadequate to improve management effectiveness. © 2023 by the authors.","biodiversity; bird sanctuary; human-made wetland; important bird area; irrigation reservoir; METT","Nepal; biodiversity; bird; conservation management; environmental management; habitat management; protected area; Ramsar Convention; wetland management; wildlife management","","","","","Banganga Irrigation System Water Users Association; Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine; Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation; Keidanren Nature Conservation Fund; Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection; SLUB Dresden; TUD Dresden University of Technology; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO; United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Technische Universität Dresden, TUD; Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz, nukleare Sicherheit und Verbraucherschutz, BMUV","Funding text 1: The Article Processing Charge (APC) was funded by the joint publication funds of the TU Dresden, including Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine and the SLUB Dresden, as well as the Open Access Publication Funding of the DFG.

However, monitoring and reporting have been inadequate to fully achieve the goals of the Convention. We argue that current reporting mechanisms, including the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM), and the R-METT reporting framework adopted at the 12th Conference of the Parties, are not well adapted to wetland systems and the objectives of the Ramsar Convention. This paper outlines one possible structure for a new reporting mechanism, explicitly focused on the Convention’s objectives of maintaining ecological character and promoting wise use within the context of sustainable development. Through these lenses, we developed a 15-question framework that would have site managers compile the most pertinent information relating to these two points quickly, including providing operational definitions, identifying allowable uses, quantifying economic benefits, reporting fundamental monitoring data, and assessing stakeholder engagement opportunities. We argue that, if we are to provide an informed outlook for the next half-century of wetland conservation under the Ramsar Convention, we must begin by refining its information-gathering protocols for its system of wetlands of international importance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Assessment; Monitoring; Ramsar Convention; Reporting mechanisms; Wise use","Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Wetlands; Anatidae; Conservation; Wetlands; Ecological character; Information gathering; Management effectiveness; Operational definition; Protected area management; Reporting mechanisms; Stakeholder engagement; Wetland conservation; conservation management; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; habitat conservation; habitat management; prioritization; protected area; Ramsar Convention; stakeholder; wetland management; article; comparative effectiveness; human; manager; quantitative analysis; stakeholder engagement; sustainable development; wetland; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; Environmental protection","","","","","Department of Earth and Environment; FIU Department of Biological Sciences; Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center; Tinker Foundation, TF; Florida International University, FIU","This research was funded through a Florida International University (FIU) Tropics Research Grant (2019), Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center’s Tinker Field Research Collaborative Grant funded by the Tinker Foundation, Inc.

Functions of the country’s PA policy include the reduction of deforestation, forest conservation, and decreasing human pressure on natural resources. This study aimed to assess the drivers of forest intactness and fragmentation in selected terrestrial PAs. Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) scores were used to consider the impact of drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) change, including economic development, population, road networks, cultivation, and PA management, on the percentage of forest cover and different fragmentation metrics in the PAs. The study conducted a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Multiple Regression Analysis to identify the significant drivers of LULC change for each response variable. CCA and Multiple Regression Analysis results showed the most important predictors of LULC based on their canonical weights: cultivation within the PA, the human development index, and the regional gross domestic product. Aside from being the most important driving factor based on the CCA, cultivation inside the PA was also found to be a common significant variable for most dependent variables. Other significant factors were poverty index, population, and road density, which could all provide a basis for the observed PA fragmentation. The study also found that higher METT scores had a negative influence on the open forest and a positive effect on patch richness. This indicates that open forests tend to decrease as PA management improves while patch richness tends to increase. Furthermore, there is no data to support that METT scores have a significant influence on other response variables. © 2023, Philippine-American Academy of Science and Engineering.

This study aims to [1] determine the plant and other forest bioresource utilization of the local communities in NNNP, [2] assess the threats to the park and its biodiversity due to the utilization of bioresources, and [3] evaluate the Institutional Management Regime for NNNP. The data was gathered using focus groups, key informant interviews, and household surveys. For the secondary data, information was also accessed from the Office of the Protected Area Superintendent and local government units. One hundred thirteen (113) species are used for food (26%), ornamental (24%), herbal or medicinal value (19%), construction (12%), commercial (9%), charcoal and fuel wood (8%), and craft (3%) based on data collected from 643 families in the 11 cities and municipalities that make up the protected area. Housing construction, settlement, and the production of annual and non-perennial timber crops were all noted as major threats identified in the park. According to the review of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), the “context” and “planning” components were the strengths of the protected area employing the management rating of 64 and 53.8%, respectively. The Republic Act No. 11038, commonly known as the Expanded National Integrated Protected Area System (ENIPAS), is the sole unambiguous law that governs bioresource harvesting in protected areas. In addition, policies imposed by cooperatives and villages were used to control the usage and harvesting of bioresources. These findings gave us a crucial socioeconomic and institutional understanding of the landscape, preparing us to make interventions and create management plans to deal with problems involving the use of bioresources in the protected area. © 2023, Department of Science and Technology.

Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

Data was collected from documents on major conservation activities of the PA. Conservation outputs indicators of annual numbers of patrols organized, mammal and Roan Antelope observed, illegal activities recorded, offenders arrested, and livelihood beneficiaries were related to the METT scores in Spearman correlation tests. There were no statistically significant relationships between each of the METT elements and number of patrols, mammals and Roan Antelope observations. However, illegal activities, offenders arrested, and livelihood beneficiaries strongly correlated positively with all the elements. Again, Pearson correlation tests among patrols, illegal activities and mammals observed were not statistically significant. The findings indicate the PA socio-economic benefits to communities was positive. However, management must eliminate illegal logging that suggestively caused decline in mammal observations (X=2895.6, Std.=867.7, Range=2507). © 2022 by the author(s).","","Ghana; conservation management; correlation; nature reserve; population decline; ruminant; tracking","","","","","Ghana Sustainable Land and Water Management Project; World Bank Group, WBG","This study evaluated the METT assessment on the management effectiveness of the Gbele Resource Reserve in Ghana.

Despite some initiatives for protected areas management effectiveness evaluation, the information on this matter is scarce and a general overview is missing. In this context, this study aims at investigating problems faced by National Parks in Ecuador and developing a base level management effectiveness evaluation for possible comparative assessments in the future. Focusing on all 12 legally established National Parks, this study used the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), an internationally consecrated methodology based on a scorecard questionnaire that includes six elements of management cycle: context, planning, inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes. The questionnaire was applied to Ecuadorian National Parks management teams through face-to-face interviews. The resulted overall management effectiveness indices are between 40.6% and 99.0%. The general condition of biodiversity value was considered as good in line with the legal status and National Parks design but topics related to budget allocation, tourism arrangements, communities and indigenous people received lower scores. The low enforcement emphasis is not necessarily the best way to improve management effectiveness; the identified issues should be addressed by including communities and indigenous people in the decision making and benefits sharing as well as strategic allocation of budgetary resources, with proper adaptation to Natural Parks’ specific conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the quality of management of the vast majority of reserves remains unknown, and many are suspected to be ""paper parks"". Moreover, the degree to which management can be enhanced through targeted conservation projects remains broadly speculative. Proven links between improved reserve management and the delivery of conservation outcomes are even more elusive. In this paper we present results on how management effectiveness scores change in protected areas receiving conservation investment, using a globally expanded database of protected area management effectiveness, focusing on the ""management effectiveness tracking tool"" (METT). Of 1934 protected areas with METT data, 722 sites have at least two assessments. Mean METT scores increased in 69.5% of sites while 25.1% experienced decreases and 5.4% experienced no change over project periods (median 4. years). Low initial METT scores and longer implementation time were both found to positively correlate with larger increases in management effectiveness. Performance metrics related to planning and context as well as monitoring and enforcement systems increased the most while protected area outcomes showed least improvement. Using a general linear mixed model we tested the correlation between change in METT scores and matrices of 1) landscape and protected area properties (i.e. topography and size), 2) human threats (i.e. road and human population density), and 3) socio-economics (i.e. infant mortality rate). Protected areas under greater threat and larger protected areas showed greatest improvements in METT. Our results suggest that when funding and resources are targeted at protected areas under greater threat they have a greater impact, potentially including slowing the loss of biodiversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aichi target 11; Governance; Management effectiveness; Management effectiveness tracking tool; Protected area","biodiversity; conservation management; conservation planning; database; environmental monitoring; global perspective; governance approach; investment; mortality; performance assessment; protected area; socioeconomic impact","","","","","Danmarks Grundforskningsfond, DNRF, (DNRF096)","We thank C Rahbek, RJ Smith, A Ahrends, K Redford and B Child who delivered valuable input to the early version of the MS.

Our study examined the monitoring and evaluation of protected area management effectiveness (PAME) as part of an adaptive management process in the Kruger to Canyons (K2C) Biosphere Region in South Africa. Our mixed methods approach, using online questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups, revealed that most PA managers in the network were familiar with the concept of adaptive management. The most widely used PAME evaluation tool used in the region was the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT). Some PAs did not use a formal tool but gathered scientific data using methods such as game counts and vegetation surveys to judge management effectiveness. Additionally, several managers that did not use a formal tool mentioned that they were constrained by time, staff capacity or budget. The introduction of a simpler tool for managers that are time- or resource-constrained or who are working in a newly declared or in-process PA may improve PAME evaluation within the network. We suggest that there is a need for improved communication, co-learning, and information sharing regarding PAME evaluation tools. © 2023 by the authors.","adaptive management; biosphere reserve; evaluation; Kruger to Canyons; monitoring; protected area management effectiveness; UNESCO MAB","Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve; South Africa; adaptive management; monitoring; nature reserve; regulatory framework; UNESCO","","","","","Central European University, CEU","Funding for this research was gratefully received from Central European University (Vienna, Austria) in the form of a doctoral stipend as well as the Doctoral Research Support Grant.","Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

Wild tigers Panthera tigris are found in 13 countries, with habitat that is also important for ecosystem services, biodiversity and a number of other threatened species. Timber production, mineral mining, oil and gas concessions and protected areas are common land-use designations in tiger habitat. Twenty-one per cent of the current tiger range is under some form of protection, while 9% is designated as 'strictly protected,' in IUCN categories I or II. Fifteen per cent of the tiger range is under oil and gas concession. These concessions also overlap 152 protected areas, 55 of which are categorized as strictly protected. Management effectiveness tracking tool responses suggest that the majority of protected areas in the tiger range are inadequately managed to meet their objectives, and the most commonly reported management challenges are minimal enforcement and budgets. We observe that even strictly protected areas are subject to a variety of pressures, particularly resource extraction. Results imply that the establishment and enforcement of effective protected areas in each tiger landscape, sufficient to protect and grow breeding tiger populations, could help change current trends. These areas should be free from incompatible land uses, and should be adequately resourced to meet management, enforcement and monitoring challenges. Weaknesses in protected area management identified here have implications for species and ecosystem services that share the same geography as tigers. In addition, results suggest that similar issues may exist for threatened species and protected areas in other geographies as well. © 2011 World Wildlife Fund, Inc. © 2011 The Zoological Society of London.","Land use; Management effectiveness; Oil and gas; Protected area; Threatened species; Tiger","Panthera; Panthera tigris; biodiversity; ecosystem service; felid; habitat fragmentation; habitat management; land management; land use change; landscape; protected area; species conservation","","","","","","","Beckmann J.P., Seidler R.G., Wildlife and energy development: pronghorn of the Upper Green River Basin year 4 Summary, (2009); Bennett E.L., Gumal M.T., The interrelationships of commercial logging, hunting, and wildlife in Sawarak, The Cutting Edge, pp. 359-374, (2001); Important bird areas, (2010); Parks in peril, (1998); Caro T., O'Doherty G., On the use of surrogate species in conservation biology, Conserv.

However, global studies claim that the PA systems seem to fail in securing large ecosystem mosaics that are needed to protect threatened and endemic species. There is a myriad of metrices to measure the management effectiveness of protected areas. This review paper explored the use of Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) for assessing management capacity of protected areas in the Philippines and other possible indicators that are measurable and verifiable to holistically assess PA performance. Our review showed the following results: 1) Philippine protected areas showed improvement from poor to fair in METT scores from 2013 to 2017; 2) PA design elements did not fully cover species survival envelopes and suitable habitats; and 3) there was an undesirable inverse relationship between habitat quality and METT scores. To address these, we suggest the adoption of a suite of multidimensional approaches that will take into account a system level performance metric, a performance-based metric, and an ecological/biophysical metric. The combination of these metrics will provide management solutions in ensuring a strategic and sustainable delivery of the twin objectives of the protected areas in the Philippines. © Association of Systematic Biologists of the Philippines","Biodiversity conservation; Endemic species; Management effectiveness tracking tool; Mett; Philippines; Protected area management; Species survival envelopes; Threatened species","","","","","","Center for Conservation Innovations Ph Inc.; Department of Environment and Natural Resources - Biodiversity Management Bureau; civil society groups; Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ","Funding text 1: We are grateful to Mr. James Patrick Jimenez and Ms. Beatrice Hipolito for their assistance on the editing of the manuscript. We also thank the Center for Conservation Innovations Ph Inc., the Department of Environment and Natural Resources - Biodiversity Management Bureau, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH for their support on this research.; Funding text 2: Indicators under the ‘Inputs’ element, relating to staff capacity, improved to basic management, while indicators relating to financial security scored below an acceptable level (Table 2). The mean score for #13 indicator (staff number) improved from a low score (0.84 ± 0.64) in 2013 to moderate (1.38 ± 0.77) in 2017, and #14 indicator (staff training) also improved from low (1.21 ± 0.67) in 2013 to moderate (1.71 ±0.88) in 2017. This indicates that increase staff complement and skills may achieve capacity enhancement. The mean score for #3 indicator (law enforcement) also increased from 0.90 ± 0.67 to 1.52 ± 0.86, which suggests that PAs based their scores for this indicator on the numbers of deputized enforcement officers, and frequency/distance of foot patrols during monitoring activities (BMS, Lawin Forest and Biodiversity Protection System). Perhaps limitations of implementation and rollout of training and enforcement activities were connected to constraints on budget and resource management in this case. We noted 45 PAs that rated themselves as inadequately financed whereas five PAs revealed that they have no budget for management. Securing sustainable financing has become challenging because most PAs are reliant on irregular project funding from civil society groups, private stakeholders, and volunteer support from academic institutions. On the other hand, PAs with sufficient budget (e.g., Mt. Pulag National Park, Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, Aurora Memorial National Park, Mt. Mantalingahan Protected Landscape, and Cuatro Islas Protected Landscape) secured their budget from tourism revenues and visitor facility fees to supplement core government NIPAS funding.","Ambal R.G.R, Duya M.V., Cruz M.A, Coroza O.G., Vergara S.G., De Silva N., Molinyawe N., Tabaranza B., Key Biodiversity Areas in the Philippines: Priorities for Conservation, Journal of Threatened Taxa, 4, 8, (2012); Alcala A.C., Russ G.R., No-take marine reserves and reef fisheries management in the Philippines: A new people power revolution, World Development, 27, pp. 629-649, (2006); Baral N., Stern M.J., Heinen J.T, Integrated conservation and development project life cycles in the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal: Is development overpowering conservation?, Biodiversity and Conservation, 16, pp. 2903-2917, (2007); Philippine Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2028):, (2016); Cabrido C., Bringing Resilience to Filipino Communities; Biodiversity Management Bureau - Department of Environment and Natural Resources (BMB-DENR) & Deutsche; Manual on Biodiversity Assessment and Monitoring Systems for Terrestrial Ecosystems, (2017); Brandon K., Gorenflo L.J., Rodrigues A.S.L., Waller R.W., Reconciling biodiversity conservation, people, protected areas, and agricultural suitability in Mexico, World Development, 33, pp. 1403-1418, (2005); Brown L.P, Attributes of Excellence in Small Protected Area Management - Preliminary Findings, Natural Areas Journal, 14, pp. 62-63, (1994); Buckland S.

Southeast Asian protected areas faced the highest level of human pressure at the turn of the twenty-first century. To estimate their effectiveness in conserving forest cover and forest carbon stocks for 2000–2018, we used statistical matching methods to control for the non-random location of protected areas, to compare protection against a matched counterfactual. We found Southeast Asian protected areas had three times less forest cover loss than similar landscapes without protection. Protected areas that had completed management reporting using the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) conserved significantly more forest cover and forest carbon stocks than those that had not. Management scores were positively associated with the level of carbon emissions avoided, but not the level of forest cover loss avoided. Our study is the first to find that METT scores could predict the level of carbon emissions avoided in protected areas. Given that only 11% of protected areas in Southeast Asia had completed METT surveys, our results illustrate the need to scale-up protected area management effectiveness reporting programs to improve their effectiveness for conserving forests, and for storing and sequestering carbon. © 2021, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Marie Skłodowska-Curie Program, (676108); Villum Fonden, (VKR023371)","We give special thanks to everyone who collected data and made it freely available to use.

However, protection from habitat loss, poaching and other threats, is not guaranteed without adequate investment in their management. Here, we examine the relationship between management effectiveness using the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) and trends of 79 populations of mammals and birds in 12 Southeast Asian protected areas from Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Despite the negative influence of corruption on species population change, we find evidence that adequate financial and human resourcing are important determinants in achieving good biodiversity outcomes. Management resourcing, national government transparency and body size collectively explain 29% of the variation in animal population trends in our model. Our paper contributes to a growing evidence base linking management resourcing shortfalls to declining biodiversity populations in protected areas. Our key findings are relevant to international funding agencies, governments and NGOs, to aid decision making around the allocation of conservation resources in Southeast Asia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Animal population trends; Biodiversity; Government transparency; Living planet database; Management effectiveness tracking tool; Protected areas; Southeast Asia","Cambodia; Indonesia; Thailand; Viet Nam; Mammalia; biodiversity; body size; decision making; habitat loss; human resource; poaching; protected area","","","","","Marie Skłodowska-Curie Program; World Wildlife Fund, WWF; Villum Fonden, (VKR023371); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (676108)","We give special thanks to everyone who collected data and made it freely available to use.

The need to assess the management effectiveness (ME) in protected areas is increasing around the world. The ME assessment helps to improve the management of PAs and to develop a rational, long-term action plan. This study was conducted using the World Wildlife Fund for nature (WWF) Management Effectiveness Tracking Tools methodology (METT) to evaluate the ME of six PAs in central and eastern regions of Mongolia. The main purpose of this study was to assess ME and identify common threats of PAs across different natural zones and administrative areas in Mongolia. The results of this evaluation indicate that, the main threats faced by PAs in Mongolia are: (i) degradation of ecosystems, (ii) environmental pollution, and (iii) habitat fragmentation, resulting from over-exploitation and inappropriate use of natural resources. All six PAs examined have clear management goals and management decision-making systems however, their ME scores differ significantly. This research suggests that the administrative features of the individual PA influence management effectiveness and problems in the efficient implementation of management still need to be resolved. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Community participation; Management effectiveness; METT; Mongolia; Protected areas; Threats","Animals; Animals, Wild; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Mongolia; Mongolia; Conservation; Decision support systems; Environmental protection; Community participation; Management effectiveness; METT; Mongolia; Protected areas; Threats; action plan; decision making; environmental assessment; environmental management; local participation; policy implementation; protected area; article; community participation; comparative effectiveness; decision making; habitat fragmentation; Mongolia; natural resource; wildlife; animal; ecosystem; environmental protection; Mongolia; pollution; wild animal; Decision making","","","","","Department of Research and Innovation; Mongolian Ministry of Environment and Tourism; National University of Mongolia","Funding text 1: Funding: This study was funded by the Department of Research and Innovation, National University of Mongolia.; Funding text 2: We express our gratitude to those who helped us to complete this research, particularly to the Biodiversity and Adaptation to Climate Change Project (A Development Project of the Mongolian Ministry of Environment and Tourism co-financed by the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW), the park administrations? personnel and local residents for the help in field in each case study.

However, there is little evidence that these scores actually reflect the capacity of protected areas to deliver conservation outcomes. We examined the relation between indicators of management effectiveness in protected areas and the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing fire occurrence in the Amazon rainforest. We used data collected with the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) scorecard, adopted by some of the world's largest conservation organizations to track management characteristics believed to be crucial for protected-area effectiveness. We used the occurrence of forest fires from 2000 through 2010 as a measure of the effect of protected areas on undesired land-cover change in the Amazon basin. We used matching to compare the estimated effect of protected areas with low versus high METT scores on fire occurrence. We also estimated effects of individual protected areas on fire occurrence and explored the relation between these effects and METT scores. The relations between METT scores and effects of protected areas on fire occurrence were weak. Protected areas with higher METT scores in 2005 did not seem to have performed better than protected areas with lower METT scores at reducing fire occurrence over the last 10 years. Further research into the relations between management-effectiveness indicators and conservation outcomes in protected areas seems necessary, and our results show that the careful application of matching methods can be a suitable method for that purpose. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Avoided deforestation; Conservation success; Forest fires; Impact assessment; Protected areas","Conservation of Natural Resources; Fires; Tropical Climate; Amazon Basin; Amazonia; conservation management; deforestation; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; forest fire; land cover; management practice; performance assessment; prioritization; protected area; rainforest; article; environmental protection; fire; tropic climate","","","","","","","Andam K.S., Ferraro P.J., Pfaff A., Sanchez-Azofeifa G.A., Robalino J.A., Measuring the effectiveness of protected area networks in reducing deforestation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105, pp. 16089-16094, (2008); Aragao L.E.O.C., Malhi Y., Barbier N., Lima A.A., Shimabukuro Y., Anderson L., Saatchi S., Interactions between rainfall, deforestation and fires during recent years in the Brazilian Amazonia.

An evaluation of ME for Khojir National Park (KNP), one of the Iran's oldest PAs, was conducted using a multi-method approach that consisted of structured interviews, open interviews, and site visits. This was the first ME evaluation in Iran. The structured interview was based on the management effectiveness tracking tool methodology. KNP received an average score of 43 %, which is lower than the global average, illustrating that its general management was in the low-intermediate level. The indices of legal status, resource inventory, planning for land and water use, regulations, and objectives received the highest average scores, whereas education and awareness, community co-management, regular work plan, boundary demarcation, visitor facilities, budget sources, staff training, protection systems, and management plan received the lowest ones. The management system of KNP was generally established, but many problems of the management still need to be resolved. To improve ME, some countermeasures should be taken, such as increasing funding, strengthening capacity building, planning, and adaptive management, and implementing community participation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Assessment; Iran; Khojir National Park; Management effectiveness","Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Humans; Iran; Social Responsibility; Iran; Khojir National Park; Tehran [Iran]; Conservation; Environmental protection; Management science; Number theory; Personnel training; Water supply; Adaptive Management; Assessment; Community participation; Iran; Management effectiveness; Multi-method approach; National parks; Protected areas management; adaptive management; assessment method; conservation management; local participation; national park; protected area; adult; article; awareness; capacity building; education; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; financial management; human; Iran; land use; legal aspect; national park; normal human; resource management; scoring system; staff training; structured interview; water management; Management","","","","","","","Ahmadzadeha F., Liaghatia H., Hassanzadeh-Kiabib B., Mehrabiana A.R., Abdolia A., Mostafavia H., The status and conservation of the Asiatic black bear in Nikshahr County, Baluchistan District of Iran, J Nat Hist, 42, 35-36, pp. 2379-2387, (2008); Alexander M., Management Planning for Conservation; A Theoretical Basis and Practical Guide, (2008); Alexander M., Rowell T.A., Recent developments in management planning and monitoring on protected sites in the United Kingdom, Parks, 9, pp. 50-55, (1999); (2011); Aviram R., Bass M., Parker K., Extracting Hope for Bushmeat: Case studies of oil, gas, mining and logging industry efforts for improved wildlife management, Uncertain Future: The Bushmeat Crisis in Africa.

The Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) is a simple, questionnaire-based approach for assessing protected area management effectiveness (PAME). Since it was developed in 1999, it has become the most widely applied PAME tool, used in at least 127 countries worldwide. This paper reviews the development of the METT and how it has been implemented and adapted. A combination of literature review on implementation and implementation experience from the original authors and key users of the METT confirms that the METT is a relatively quick and simple way of collecting information about the status and trends of management in protected areas, and provides information to help drive management improvements. As such it is suitable for protected area managers, national protected area agencies, donors, and NGOs aiming to improve area management, and as a component of national reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The paper examines issues related to METT implementation and concludes with 12 recommendations, from using the METT to verification of results, which together help ensure the tool is implemented in the most effective way and improves the credibility of PAME assessments. © Fiona Leverington.","Assessment; Management effectiveness tracking tool; METT; PAME; Protected area management effectiveness","","","","","","UNEP-WCMC; Universities of Queensland; World Bank and WWF; Global Environment Facility, GEF; Mettler-Toledo; WWF International, WWF","Funding text 1: In the 18 years since METT 1 was published, it has become the most widely applied PAME tool globally.

During 2014-2016 the Royal Government of Bhutan developed a custom-made tool for assessing management effectiveness: The Bhutan Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool Plus (Bhutan METT +). This was implemented in Bhutan's 10 protected areas and one botanical park, and the results were verified through field trips and expert reviews. The assessment indicates that protected areas in Bhutan are well managed and there are generally good relationships with local communities, despite an increase in livestock predation and crop damage. However, effectiveness is limited by a low level of resources (both financial and appropriate technical resources) and by gaps in monitoring and research data, which limits the ability to understand the impact of conservation, react to changing conditions and undertake adaptive management to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Bhutan is in the midst of mobilizing considerable conservation funding. The Government is working in partnership with WWF to create an innovative funding mechanism for the protected area system: The Bhutan for Life initiative. The Bhutan METT + study provides an example of how to develop a baseline against which to measure the effectiveness of protected areas over time and assess the impact of conservation inputs. © 2018 Fauna and Flora International.","Bhutan; management effectiveness; METT; protected areas","Bhutan; adaptive management; assessment method; conservation planning; governance approach; management practice; partnership approach; protected area; research work; state role","","","","","WWF Bhutan Programme; WWF Tigers Alive Initiative; World Bank Group, WBG; Global Environment Facility, GEF; Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, BTFEC","We thank all the protected area staff who took part in the Bhutan METT + assessment, and Dr A.J.T.
