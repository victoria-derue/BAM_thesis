The Convention on Biological Diversity's program of work on protected areas calls on all countries to implement such systems. In 2004, the first whole of system assessment of park management effectiveness, based on the IUCN-WCPA Management Effectiveness Evaluation Framework, was undertaken in New South Wales, Australia as part of a State of the Parks reporting requirement. This article describes the development of the State of the Parks assessment tool, its elements, and how it addresses the management effectiveness difficulties associated with assessments conducted across an extensive and diverse range of park types. The importance of engaging staff, at all levels, throughout the process is highlighted, as well as the adjustments made to the assessment tool based on staff feedback. While some results are presented, the main purpose of the article is to identify and discuss important procedural and methodological considerations. These include balancing quantitative and qualitative assessment approaches, achieving a comprehensive understanding of the management processes, and responding to any problems associated with assessments. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Assessment; Evaluation; Management effectiveness; Management performance; National park; Protected area; State of Parks","Conservation of Natural Resources; Disclosure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; New South Wales; Organizational Policy; Recreation; Social Responsibility; Australasia; Australia; New South Wales; Environmental protection; Parks; Assessment; Evaluation; Management effectiveness; National park; Protected area; State of Parks; biodiversity; environmental assessment; nature conservation; performance assessment; protected area; qualitative analysis; article; Australia; data analysis; decision making; environmental management; environmental protection; information processing; qualitative research; quantitative study; Management","","","","","","","Agouridas V., Race P., Enhancing knowledge management in design education through systematic reflection practice, Concurrent Engineering Research and Applications, 15, 1, pp. 63-76, (2007); Enhancing Accountability for Performance: A Framework and Implementation Plan, (1996); Berger A.R., Hodge R.A., Natural change in the environment: A challenge to the pressure-state-response concept, Social Indicators Research, 44, pp. 255-265, (1997); A Review of Current Approaches to Performance Measurement in Protected Areas Management CNPPAM Benchmarking and Best Practice Program, (2002); Programme of Work on Protected Areas, (2004); Driessen E., Van Der Vleuten C., Schuwirth L., Van Tartwijk J., Vermunt J., The use of qualitative research criteria for portfolio assessment as an alternative to reliability evaluation: A case study, Medical Education, 39, 2, pp. 214-220, (2005); Ervin J., WWF Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) Methodology, (2003); Ferreira L.V., Sa De Lemos R.M., Buschbacher R., Batmanian G., Bensusan N.R., Lemos Costa K., Protected Areas or Endangered Spaces?

Such evaluations facilitate adaptive management to help improve planning processes, provide greater clarity to managers in determining priorities, and support the decision-making process through continuous learning. However, there are considerable challenges in implementing an evaluation program of an entire protected area system: ownership of the evaluation process must occur at all levels of the management agency; a reliable process needs to be developed; a system for information sharing is required; a culture of learning needs to be encouraged and supported; and an appreciation of the range of useful qualitative and quantitative evidence has to be fostered. In NSW, this evaluation process has been established through a State of the Parks program. This article explores some of the key challenges associated with the development of this program and identifies some of the lessons that have been learned. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptive management; Evaluation; Management effectiveness; Protected areas","adaptive management; conference proceeding; decision making; environmental management; environmental planning; implementation process; planning process; protected area","","","","","","","Allan C., Stankey G., Synthesis of lessons, Adaptive environmental management: a practical guide, pp. 341-346, (2009); Bellamy J.A., Walker D.H., McDonald G.T., Syme G.J., A. systems approach to the evaluation of natural resource management initiatives, Journal of Environmental Management, 63, pp. 407-423, (2001); Ervin J., rapid assessment and prioritization of protected area management (RAPPAM) methodology, (2003); Gilligan B., Dudley N., Fernandez de Tejada A., Toivonen H., Management effectiveness evaluation of Finland's protected areas, (2005); Guijt I., Participatory monitoring and evaluation for natural resource management and research.
